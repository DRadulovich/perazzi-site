Perazzi Shotguns - Comprehensive Reference Guide
Company History and Origins
Perazzi (Armi Perazzi S.p.A.) was founded in 1957 by Italian gunsmith Daniele Perazzi in Brescia, Italy[1][2]. Daniele started as a teenage apprentice and by age 25 opened his own factory, aiming to build the world's finest competition shotguns[2][1]. In the early 1960s he partnered with Ivo Fabbri (an ex-Fiat engineer) to improve on traditional designs. Together they developed an over/under shotgun for shooter Ennio Mattarelli, who won Olympic gold in Trap at the 1964 Tokyo Games with the Perazzi prototype[3]. This victory put the young company on the map. Perazzi's first flagship model - the MX8, named for the 1968 Mexico City Olympics - was the refined result of those efforts[4]. The MX8's success (including use by many medalists in the late 1960s) established Perazzi as a top competition gunmaker.
Throughout the 1970s-1990s, Perazzi expanded internationally. U.S. importer Ithaca Gun Co. began bringing in Perazzi guns in 1973, leading to the creation of Perazzi USA (now headquartered in Azusa, California)[5]. Daniele Perazzi personally oversaw engineering for decades, designing models specifically for American trap and other disciplines (e.g. the TM1 single-barrel trap gun for ATA Trap, and others like the SC1)[5]. He collaborated with champion shooters: for example, Ray Stafford (ATA Hall of Famer) helped develop the DB81 O/U in 1981 (named for shooter Dan Bonillas) and the MX10 in 1990 (a top-single with adjustable rib)[6]. In 1999 Perazzi worked with Stafford on the MX2000/RS unsingle (the "RS" bearing Ray s initials)[7]. Perazzi also created special editions for the American market, such as the Grand America 1 and 2 (an unsingle and a top-single model) tailored to ATA shooters[8]. Over time, the company balanced limited production (only ~1,500 guns/year) with a reputation for elite quality[9][10]. Daniele's children, Mauro and Roberta Perazzi, joined the company and later assumed leadership roles. Daniele Perazzi passed away in 2012 at age 80, shortly after the London Olympics where Perazzi guns won 12 of 15 shotgun medals[11]. The family continued to run the business, and in 2023 Perazzi entered a new era by partnering with the Czech CSG Group, which acquired an 80% stake (Mauro and Roberta retaining 20% and operational control)[12]. Under this arrangement, Perazzi's legacy of family-led craftsmanship remains intact while gaining secure footing for future growth in the global luxury arms market[13][14].

Product Evolution: Models, Variations, and Disciplines
Perazzi's product line has evolved from one core design into a wide range of models optimized for different shooting disciplines. At the heart of all Perazzi guns is the original action design of the MX8, which serves as a modular platform for trap, skeet, sporting clays, live pigeon, and game gun configurations. Nearly every model variant is a permutation of this base, with adjustments to barrels, ribs, stocks, and features to suit specific uses. Over time, Perazzi introduced model families and numbering schemes to denote these variations:
	o	MX Series (Over/Under): The "MX" prefix (for example, MX1 through MX14, MX20, etc.) encompasses their competition O/U guns. The MX8 (12ga O/U with removable trigger) is the archetype introduced in the 1960s and remains a gold standard. Perazzi subsequently released small-gauge versions like MX20 (20ga), MX28 (28ga), MX410 (.410 bore) to cover sub-gauge sporting and game shooting. Many MX models correspond to incremental design tweaks or special configurations - for instance, the MX3 and MX3 Special (1970s variants), MX5/MX7 (economy or fixed-trigger versions), and MX9 (a rare variant). The numbering sometimes marked special editions or years (e.g. MX16 for 16ga, or possibly MX14 etc., though not all numbers were sequentially released). The MX series all use a low-profile Boss-derived action and most have a drop-out trigger group (except where noted), making them popular among serious competitors for ease of service and configuration[16][17]. The MX12 is a notable offshoot: mechanically similar to MX8 but with a fixed trigger group and coil springs (marketed in the 1990s for those preferring simpler, non-removable triggers)[16]. In practice, an MX12 or its variant MX2000S shoots the same as an MX8, but lacks the quick-change trigger feature. Perazzi's naming also includes grade suffixes (see Pricing below), but fundamentally all "MX" O/Us share the same lineage of action geometry and locking mechanism.
	o	High Tech Series: Around 2015, Perazzi introduced the High Tech (HT) line as a modern evolution of the MX8. The High Tech guns retain the MX8's removable trigger and overall design but feature a wider, heavier receiver to alter weight distribution[18]. By adding mass between the hands (in the receiver), the High Tech is designed to reduce muzzle flip and recoil, yielding a smoother swing and more "centered" balance[18][19]. Cosmetically, High Tech actions are slightly bulkier and often come with distinctive engraved or colored side panels (some with inlaid flags or custom text as ordered). Variants include the HT 12 (standard High Tech O/U, usually 12ga), HT RS (with adjustable rib for trap, "RS" often indicating a higher rib or responsive stock), and HT 2020 or HT 2024 special editions (limited releases with unique aesthetics or small improvements). The High Tech S (HTS) models are the fixed-trigger counterparts (S for "solid" trigger) - mechanically similar guns but without a detachable trigger group. High Tech S models come in 12ga and smaller gauges on scaled frames (20/28/.410). Despite the new branding, the High Tech series is an extension of the MX concept, and components are largely compatible. These models target competitive shooters wanting the latest in recoil mitigation and stability without departing from Perazzi's proven action.
	o	Single-Barrel Trap Guns (TM Series): For American trapshooting, which often uses single-barrel shotguns for singles and handicap events, Perazzi developed the TM1 in the late 1960s. The TM1 (and later TMX, TM9 series) are break-open single-barrel guns with a similar action style but simplified (a top lever and internal hammer for one barrel). The TM series typically have a fixed trigger (non-dropout) and a tall Monte Carlo comb for the rising targets in trap. Over the years, Perazzi refined these with adjustable ribs and improved ergonomics: e.g. the TMX introduced a higher rib; the TM9 and TM9X (modern variants) offer refined barrel dynamics and ribs. These single-barrel models were extremely popular in ATA/Grand American competitions in the 1970s-90s. Notably, the Grand America 1 and 2 (released in the late 1990s) were essentially TM guns named in honor of the ATA Grand American tournament - the Grand America 1 was an unsingle (single barrel with under-rib, shooting lower point of impact) and the 2 was a top single, each designed to excel at handicap trap[8]. While O/U combos are also used in trap (for doubles events), the dedicated single-barrel Perazzis remain iconic in American trap venues.
	o	Other Notable Models: Perazzi has occasionally built side-by-side shotguns and special editions. The Mirage is one historical model name - essentially an MX8 sold under a different name in certain markets (notably the Ithaca-imported "Ithaca Perazzi Mirage" of the 1970s)[20]. The Comp I (short for Competition I) was another early model designation for an O/U in the 1960s before the MX naming took hold. MT6 was a 1970s model (the name reportedly referencing the 1976 Montreal Olympics) which featured a fixed trigger and lower cost - it eventually evolved into the MX12 concept. DB81, as mentioned, was a custom variant for Dan Bonillas and became a sought-after trap gun in the '80s[6]. MX2000 (introduced at the turn of the millennium) was essentially an MX8 with updated styling and options; the MXS (a more recent model name) is used for certain sporting configurations, often denoting fixed-trigger sporting guns. Perazzi also labels some models by purpose: e.g. SC3 or SCO are not model types but grade designations (engraving/wood level - see Pricing), and terms like "Lusso" (Italian "or  luxury ) often indicate higher grade finish. For live-pigeon shooting (an international sport demanding ultra-reliable guns), Perazzi made specialized configurations, sometimes just referred to as "pigeon grade" guns - essentially MX8s with tighter chokes, heavier weights, and often no safety. The company's philosophy has been to keep the core mechanism constant while offering "numerous variations specifically built for each discipline, all based on the MX8 platform". This modular approach means a shooter gets a familiar feel whether they pick up a Perazzi for Olympic trap, a driven game hunt, or a sporting clays championship - only the fittings differ.
Evolution Highlights: The MX8 design (birthed in the 1960s) has proven so sound that it underpins 50+ years of Perazzi products. Later developments mostly involved ergonomic and accessory innovations: adjustable ribs and combs, different barrel lengths and rib heights (e.g. MX10/RS introduced adjustability in rib and stock), incorporation of coil springs as an alternative to traditional leaf springs, and aesthetic customizations. The High Tech series represents one of the more fundamental tweaks (wider receiver mass) to the classic action in decades. Yet even the High Tech is backwards-compatible in many parts. In summary, Perazzi's product evolution is characterized by continuity, with the company preferring to incrementally perfect its competition gun formula rather than completely reinvent it. Shooters can transition between models with ease - a testament to the consistency of design. A 2020s High Tech still traces its DNA straight back to that 1960s MX8 that Daniele Perazzi and Ennio Mattarelli honed for Olympic victory.
Technical Design and Manufacturing Details
Action and Locking Mechanism: All Perazzi shotguns utilize a low-profile, Boss-type locking system refined for strength and longevity. The monobloc construction is central to this design - each O/U barrel set uses a solid monobloc (breech block) into which the barrel tubes are fitted and soldered. This method, an "evolution of the Boss system" from 19th-century British guns, provides exceptional robustness[21]. The monobloc contains the locking bites and side lugs. A large, dual locking bolt emerges from the receiver bottom and engages these bites, preventing the gun from opening upon firing and securely holding the barrels in place[21]. Perazzi actions have broad, deep hinge pins and wide hook surfaces, maximizing metal-on-metal contact area for stability[22]. This yields an action famed for durability - wear is distributed, so the guns handle tens of thousands of shots with minimal loosening. The receiver profile is streamlined and compact from hinge pin to trigger, keeping the barrels low relative to the hands for reduced muzzle flip[22]. All weight is kept below the bore axis, lowering the center of mass and helping absorb recoil straight back into the shooter's shoulder rather than flipping up[21]. The result is a shotgun that feels balanced and "handles better" under recoil due to this engineering[23]. Notably, the High Tech variant's widened receiver adds about 3-4 ounces directly in line with the chambers, further dampening recoil and "distributing weight between the hands perfectly" to enhance balance[18].
Barrels: Perazzi barrels are forged from a proprietary high-grade chromoly steel alloy, which the company closely guards[24]. Rather than using fast mass-production methods like cold hammer forging, Perazzi machines and hand-laps its barrels to precise specifications. The company explicitly notes that "cold hammer forging is not the proper way to produce the finest barrel tubes" - it hardens the steel excessively and can induce stress[25]. Perazzi's approach yields barrels with excellent elasticity and vibrational harmonics, contributing to both durability and favorable shot patterns. Furthermore, Perazzi barrels are not chrome-lined, unlike many mass-produced shotguns[26]. While chrome lining can ease cleaning and prevent corrosion, Perazzi eschews it in favor of maintaining the subtle balance and consistency of the bore (chrome lining is typically seen in lower-cost or field guns)[26]. Instead, the bare steel bores are polished to a mirror finish. Perazzi offers a range of bore diameters (18.3mm up to 18.9mm in 12ga, often customer-specified)[27], and barrels are available in various lengths - common standards are ~29.5", 30.75", 31.5" for competition O/Us, with custom lengths on request[28]. Each barrel set is soldered and regulated by hand to ensure both barrels shoot to the same point of impact (for O/Us). Ribs are then attached (soldered or screwed depending on type): Perazzi offers flat ribs, medium ribs, and high ribs, including adjustable rib designs with 3, 4, or even 5 notch adjustment systems to alter point of impact[29]. For example, trap models like the MX10 or HT RS have high adjustable ribs for fine-tuning 70/30 or 80/20 POI, whereas sporting models often have flat or low ramp ribs for a 50/50 POI. The company also makes interchangeable chokes (internal screw-in chokes, optional at extra cost) but many purists opt for fixed chokes reamed to preference, believing in their pattern consistency. Barrel sets can be ordered with or without side ribs (e.g. skeet guns often delete side ribs to reduce weight)[30]. Monobloc flexibility: Perazzi's standardized monobloc and threading allow for gauge converters - e.g. smaller gauge barrels on a 12ga frame (with some extra fitting). However, these are custom orders and usually incur an extra charge for the additional barrels and fitting[31].
Triggers and Lockwork: One of Perazzi's signature features is the detachable trigger group on many models. The MX8-style trigger is a self-contained unit that can be removed from the bottom of the receiver in seconds by pushing a latch inside the trigger guard. This design allows quick servicing or swapping of triggers (for example, a shooter can carry a spare trigger group to a competition). The drop-out trigger is a true trigger-plate action containing sears, hammers, springs, and the safety/barrel selector. The advantage is not only quick accessibility but also a more compact action frame. Perazzi's triggers are renowned for their simplicity and crisp break. "Only a true mechanical genius can make things simple," a Perazzi presentation notes, highlighting that fewer parts, larger working surfaces, and straightforward mechanics lead to greater reliability[32]. The MX8 trigger group epitomizes this: it uses two large hammers driven by V-shaped leaf springs (flat springs) in the classic configuration, giving extremely fast lock times and a clean feel. Alternatively, customers can request coil springs in the removable trigger - coil (helical) mainsprings are more durable long-term and easier for novice gunsmiths to replace, though they may have a slightly slower lock time. Perazzi offers both options to suit preference[33]. The fixed-trigger models (like MX12, HT-S, etc.) have the trigger components mounted permanently in the receiver - these typically use coil springs only for robustness[16]. Fixed trigger designs lack the quick-swap ability but are simpler in construction and often a touch lighter in weight in the action.
Other trigger options include selective or non-selective triggers. Many Perazzi competition guns have a non-selective trigger set to fire the bottom barrel first by default (common in trap). A selectable trigger (allowing the shooter to choose which barrel fires first via a selector on the safety) is available on request or standard on some sporting models. Perazzi even engineered double trigger groups in early days (an unusual double-trigger MX8 exists but is very rare)[34]. More common is the use of release triggers among trap shooters - Perazzi doesn't factory-install release triggers, but their simple mechanism is easily converted by reputable gunsmiths. The company's ethos is that simplicity equals reliability: The internal parts are robust and few in number. For example, rather than complex linkages, the hammers directly engage sear tails; and the intercepting safety sears are minimal. This design results in a very low maintenance requirement - Perazzi famously does not mandate an "annual service" for its guns, unlike some competitors[35]. They suggest only that a qualified smith inspect the gun periodically, and that major overhaul (replacement of springs, firing pins, etc.) might be done after 30,000-40,000 rounds if needed[35]. This is a testament to the stoutness of parts and the uncomplicated, high-precision fit of the mechanism.
Springs: As noted, leaf springs vs. coil springs are a point of discussion. Perazzi's leaf (flat) springs provide extremely fast hammer fall but can eventually break from metal fatigue - many shooters keep a spare leaf spring or two on hand, though they often last many thousands of shots. Coil springs on the other hand compress over time (slowly weakening), but rarely snap abruptly[36]. Perazzi allows the customer to choose; in fact, "the detachable MX8 trigger group is offered with flat springs or coil" at the buyer's preference[33]. Changing a spring is relatively simple: a leaf spring can be replaced in minutes with a tool; a coil spring assembly can be swapped as well. The company argues that their design minimizes the number of springs under tension overall, thereby reducing frequency of replacement[36]. Outside of the trigger, small coil springs are used for functions like ejectors, top lever, etc., and these are inexpensive and easily sourced.
Barrel Regulation and Balance: Perazzi pays great attention to how the gun balances and swings. They offer barrels in various weights (per length) - e.g. a 32" barrel can be ordered in a heavier or lighter contour, which influences balance point[37][38]. Competitors might request a heavier barrel for stability in a sustained swing, or lighter for quicker handling; Perazzi will even balance the gun to the customer's request at the factory by minor adjustments in stock weight or barrel weight[37][38]. The High Tech design, as mentioned, moves the weight distribution slightly, placing more mass in the center. According to reviewers, "its unique weight distribution improves the fluidity of handling and reduces recoil" while maintaining the lively feel of a Perazzi[39]. Stocks can further tune balance - many Perazzi stocks have hollowed bolt-access holes where weight can be added. Perazzi also frequently fits a slightly cast-off stock and palm swell on right-hand guns to improve pointability and recoil absorption into the shoulder pocket (left-hand stocks are available too). All stocks are oil-finished (or optional lacquer) and made from high-grade walnut, contributing to damping recoil as well[40][41].
Machining and Craftsmanship: In production, Perazzi blends CNC precision with hand fitting. The factory in Botticino, Italy spans 9000 m^2 and uses modern CNC machines to fabricate receivers, trigger parts, and barrel components to fine tolerances[40]. However, each gun then undergoes significant hand fitting by experienced gunsmiths, especially for mating the barrels to the action and fitting the wood to metal[40][42]. Soldering of barrels and ribs is done by craftsmen to ensure regulation (precise convergence of shot). Before final finishing, every shotgun is test fired and proofed, then the customer's requested pattern and point-of-impact are verified in an on-site underground testing tunnel[43]. Adjustability is another technical hallmark: Perazzi can incorporate features like adjustable combs (either a wood-comb cut with set screws or a soft comb insert) and adjustable buttplates if desired, to fine-tune fit and point of impact. Many trap models today come standard with an adjustable comb for vertical tuning. Additionally, Perazzi's removable trigger allows swapping of pull and release conversions or different trigger blade shapes (e.g. a thicker or more rear-set blade for small hands). Overall, the manufacturing philosophy is "traditional gunsmithing combined with state-of-the-art technology, using the best raw materials"[44] - machines handle the repetitive precision cuts, but human hands ensure that final lockup, trigger pull, and balance meet Perazzi's exacting standards (or the customer's specifications).
Athletes and Achievements
Perazzi's dominance in competitive shooting is legendary - the brand's shotguns have been used to win literally hundreds of championships around the world. Since the 1960s, Olympic shooters using Perazzi guns have earned dozens of medals. By the company's count, Perazzi shotguns contributed to "62 Olympic medals at 11 Olympics" through 2021[15]. This includes many gold medal victories. The breakthrough was Ennio Mattarelli's gold in 1964 (Men's Trap) with the early Perazzi; from there, a "multitude of Olympic shooters from various countries have gone on to win gold, silver and bronze medals with Perazzi guns"[3]. Notable champions who have shot Perazzi include:
	o	Ennio Mattarelli (ITA) - 1964 Olympic Trap Gold (Tokyo) with a Perazzi, the company's first Olympic win[3]. Mattarelli collaborated in designing the MX8, proving its worth on the world stage.
	o	Bob Braithwaite (GBR) - 1968 Olympic Trap Gold (Mexico City). While Braithwaite famously won with another brand, Perazzi's MX8 was created for this Olympics and the event put MX8 on equal footing with long-established makers[45][46]. (By the 1970s, most Italian and British team shooters shifted to Perazzi.)
	o	Luciano Giovannetti (ITA) - Back-to-back Olympic Trap Golds in 1980 (Moscow) and 1984 (LA) with Perazzi. These wins cemented Perazzi's dominance in international trap.
	o	Kim Rhode (USA) - A six-time Olympic medalist (including three Golds) in women's shotgun events. Rhode won her first gold in Double Trap at Atlanta 1996 at age 17 with her trusty Perazzi, becoming the youngest female Olympic shooting champion[47]. She continued to use a custom Perazzi (MX12 and MX8 variants) for subsequent medals; her Perazzi was even affectionately named and was famously stolen and recovered in 2008[47][48]. Rhode's sustained success across trap and skeet showcased Perazzi's versatility.
	o	Michael Diamond (AUS) - Two-time Olympic Gold medalist in Trap (1996, 2000), multiple world champion, who shot Perazzi MX series guns in competition.
	o	David Kosteleck'y (C-E)   2008 Olympic Trap Gold; a long-time Perazzi shooter with a partnership spanning 20+ years[49][50]. He credits Perazzi's equipment and support for his success and remains an ambassador of the brand.
	o	Giovanni Pellielo (ITA) - One of the most decorated trap shooters (4 Olympic medals across 2000-2016). He used Perazzi guns (various MX8 derivatives) throughout his career, often appearing in Perazzi's booth as a testament to their quality.
	o	Jessica Rossi (ITA) - 2012 Olympic Trap Gold with a world-record score, using a Perazzi. Italy's shooting team in London 2012 was entirely armed with Perazzis, contributing to the remarkable 12 out of 15 medals won with the brand at those Games[51][11].
	o	Diana Bacosi & Gabriele Rossetti (ITA) - 2016 Olympic Skeet Gold medalists (women's and men's respectively), both shooting Perazzi (Rossetti with an MX2000S). These victories continued Italy's proud tradition with the marque.
	o	George Digweed (GBR) - While not an Olympian (sporting clays is not Olympic), Digweed is a living legend in clay shooting with over 25 world titles in Sporting and FITASC. He won many of these championships with Perazzi shotguns. As one source quipped, Perazzis "seem to work well if you point them in the right direction," given Digweed's dominance[52]. His use of models like the MX2000 and MX8 in the 1990s-2000s lent credibility among sporting clays shooters worldwide.
	o	Wendell Cherry (USA) - A top Sporting Clays professional who shoots Perazzi and has been involved in recent brand storytelling (part of Perazzi's Champions Network content). Cherry has numerous championships and is a leading coach, influencing many to consider Perazzi.
	o	Other Notables: Almost every Olympic cycle, a majority of medalists in trap and skeet are using Perazzi. For example, at Tokyo 2020 (held in 2021), shooters from countries as diverse as Spain, San Marino, and the USA medaled with Perazzi guns. The Chinese shooting team has also used Perazzi for skeet champions (e.g. Zhang Shan, 1992 skeet gold, and later teams). In live pigeon and ZZ (helice) shooting, Perazzi's presence is equally strong - champions like Josep Guardiola (ESP) and Will Fennell (USA) have won major live-pigeon championships with Perazzi guns.
The influence of these athletes on the brand has been profound. Perazzi often works closely with champions to refine gun features (as seen with Ray Stafford and others) and also leverages their success in marketing. The guns are sometimes nicknamed after shooters (e.g. the "Dan Bonillas model" for the DB81). Moreover, the prestige of winning Olympic gold with a Perazzi became a self-perpetuating legacy - top competitors gravitate to the brand that has proven itself on the podium. By 2023, Perazzi could claim well over 60 Olympic medals including at least 14 Gold medals in trap/skeet events, far more than any other shotgun maker. This track record creates an aura that a Perazzi is "the gun of champions." Indeed, many shooters say owning a Perazzi connects them to this lineage of excellence. The company's modern marketing (see next section) explicitly celebrates this idea, featuring champions' personal stories and emphasizing that Perazzi is the choice of those who pursue mastery.
Brand Philosophy and Ethos
Perazzi's brand goes beyond the tangible product - it's imbued with notions of legacy, exclusivity, and a nearly artistic pursuit of perfection. The company prides itself on a philosophy that a Perazzi shotgun is not merely bought; it is earned. As an internal narrative puts it: "Perazzi isn't something you buy, but something you strive for - something you grow into, an identity where prestige, legacy, and artistry converge."[53] This ethos positions owning a Perazzi as a transformative journey for the shooter. The marketing tone is often reverential: a Perazzi is portrayed as an instrument forged by master craftsmen and then further shaped by the victories and dedication of its owner[54][55].
Four core values dominate Perazzi's brand ethos:
	o	Exclusivity & Prestige: Perazzi deliberately maintains a low volume, high-quality production. Each gun is essentially custom-built, so owning one confers entry into an exclusive circle. The brand emphasizes that its experience is reserved for those truly committed to mastery[56]. Rather than sponsoring every event or plastering logos widely, Perazzi often opts for selective presence (for instance, focusing on marquee events or high-profile clientele). This selective approach cultivates a prestigious image - a Perazzi is a status symbol among shotguns, akin to a Ferrari among cars.
	o	Craftsmanship as Art: Every Perazzi is hand-fitted and can be highly decorated. The company speaks of its guns in terms of artistry and legacy: "more than equipment - it is artistry and passion manifested, forever linking the hands of artisans with the souls of those who hold them."[57] The fine engraving options (from traditional English scroll to elaborate game scenes with gold inlay) and exhibition-grade walnut stocks reinforce that these are functional works of art. Perazzi often highlights its veteran craftsmen in communications, stressing the continuity of traditional gunmaking skills. They have even published books and videos showing the making of a Perazzi, to underscore the point that these shotguns carry a soul and heritage.
	o	Emotional Connection & Storytelling: The brand actively cultivates emotional narratives around its guns. Shooters often recount their Perazzi's history - the medals it's won, the thousands of targets it has broken. Perazzi's marketing in recent years taps into this by presenting stories of champions and everyday enthusiasts whose life with a Perazzi symbolizes personal growth. In fact, Perazzi launched "The Champions Network (TCN)" as a content strategy built on storytelling[58]. TCN involves champion shooters (like Olympic medalists and world champions) sharing intimate stories of their journey and how their Perazzi accompanied them through triumphs and trials[59][60]. The idea is to inspire readers to feel what it means to shoot a Perazzi, creating aspiration through authentic stories rather than overt ads. This approach recognizes that owning such a shotgun is often the fulfillment of a dream for shooters - thus, advertising is framed as inviting one to "become part of something extraordinary"[61]. Many customers indeed speak of their Perazzi with affection and reverence, often keeping them for life.
	o	Mastery & Transformation: Perhaps most distinctively, Perazzi markets itself as a catalyst for personal transformation. The message is that choosing a Perazzi signifies a commitment to excellence - "transforming not only your performance but your very identity."[62] In other words, the gun is portrayed as an extension of the shooter's will to master their sport. This almost philosophical stance sets Perazzi apart from brands that just sell features or prices. The company uses taglines and narratives implying that owning a Perazzi is a rite of passage to join the greats. There's a focus on legacy - that each gun inherits a lineage of past victories and, in the hands of a new owner, continues that legacy. This is evident in promotions like the Perazzi Experience, where new buyers are treated to a factory visit and fitting, making the purchase a memorable event in itself (more on that below). The emotional high point of this narrative is sometimes described as an almost spiritual culmination; one document says: "Owning a Perazzi transcends possession - it becomes a profound affirmation of your rightful place within an enduring legacy."[63].
In practical terms, these brand values mean Perazzi rarely competes on price or mass-market appeal. They focus on being the aspirational choice for serious shooters. The company's slogans and content often avoid technical jargon in favor of poetic descriptions of the shooter's journey. Even so, they avoid empty "marketing fluff" - the tone is typically formal, confident, and storied, befitting a heritage brand. For example, Perazzi's own style guide notes to use "quiet authority" and inspiration from real champions[64]. It's a luxury brand approach: sell the experience and identity as much as the product. The The Champions Network (TCN) exemplifies this, using a phased storytelling campaign (initiation, immersion, revelation, culmination) to draw the audience into "what it truly means to hold, wield, and embody a Perazzi"[65][66]. Through such efforts, Perazzi reinforces that buying their shotgun is not just an equipment upgrade - it's joining a storied family with a rich past and an exciting future. This brand philosophy has resonated particularly well in shotgun sports, where tradition and personal passion are deeply intertwined.
Customization and the Ordering Process
One of Perazzi's most distinctive propositions is that every gun is essentially custom-made to order. Unlike many manufacturers where "custom shop" guns carry a huge premium, Perazzi offers full customization as a standard part of the buying process. In fact, they often say they are "the only company that offers a full custom gun at production gun prices." This means when you decide to purchase a Perazzi, you have an extensive menu of options to tailor the shotgun to your exact needs, usually without extra cost for most options (only certain deluxe features add surcharges).
A buyer typically has two paths: buying off-the-shelf (from existing inventory at Perazzi or a distributor) or ordering a bespoke gun. Many dealers stock some popular configurations, but serious customers often choose to order and wait. "It won't cost any more to go down the custom route, but it will take longer," as one buying guide notes, and the experience of getting exactly what you want is highly valued[67]. The wait is usually around 6 months for production (since each gun is built from scratch)[40][68]. Perazzi does not guarantee a fixed delivery date - the Italian philosophy is "it will be ready when it's ready"   but the typical timeline is part of the anticipation for customers[69].
Customization Options: Perazzi's order form reads like a buffet of choices. Nearly every aspect of the gun can be specified:
	o	Model and Purpose: First, you choose the model platform (MX8, MX12, High Tech, etc.) and the discipline configuration (Trap, Skeet, Sporting, Live Pigeon, etc.). Remember, many models are the same action with different setup. For example, if you want a removable trigger, you'd base it on an MX8 or High Tech; if fixed trigger, an MX12 or High Tech S, etc[16]. You also specify gauge (12ga is most common, but 20ga, 28ga, .410 are available, either on a scaled frame or as sub-gauge barrels on a 12ga frame).
	o	Barrel Specifications: You select barrel length - standard offerings are 29'' (75cm), 30'' (78cm), or 31'' (80cm), but any length can be ordered, even non-metric like 30'' or 32''[28]. Barrel weight/profiles are chosen; you can request a specific weight or ask Perazzi to balance the gun to a neutral point[37]. Chamber length can be 2'' (70mm) or 3'' (76mm) depending on whether magnum loads or steel shot use is intended[27]. Chokes: Decide on fixed chokes (and specify the constriction for each barrel, e.g. Improved Modified & Full) or multi-choke (screw-in). If multi-choke, it's an extra-cost option and typically comes with a set of 4-6 choke tubes[70]. Many competition shooters still prefer fixed chokes, and Perazzi will bore them exactly to your request (you can even have each barrel different, say one barrel true Cylinder for skeet and the other Modified)[71]. Rib style: There is a plethora of rib choices. Options include a flat rib (often 11mm parallel or tapered 11->7mm) for sporting or skeet, a semi-high fixed rib (like the Perazzi ProTrap rib, a few mm raised), an adjustable rib (common on trap models: e.g. MX2000/3 has an adjustable 3-notch rib, MX10 has 4-notch), a high fixed rib (e.g. MX2005 has a very high rib), or even an extra-high rib (MX2008, for Olympic Bunker double trap)[72]. The High Tech model introduced a unique reverse-tapered rib (wider at the muzzle than at the breech) as an option, claimed to give a better sight picture[73]. You can specify rib width (11x7, 11x11, 7x7, etc.) and even whether the rib surface is flat or concave and whether it has a center sight channel ("tramline")[72]. Additionally, you can request with or without a mid-bead sight, choice of front bead (white, red, brass, etc.)[30]. Side ribs on the barrels can be solid, ventilated, or deleted entirely (some skeet shooters remove side ribs to lighten barrels)[74]. All these are decided up front in the order.
	o	Stock and Forend: This is where personalization really shines. Stock dimensions - drop at comb, drop at heel, length of pull, cast (on/off), toe angle, pitch - can be custom tailored to the shooter's measurements[75]. Perazzi or its dealers often use a try-gun to measure the customer (or customers can provide measurements from a fitting session). Many competitive shooters opt for an adjustable comb to allow fine tuning; Perazzi can cut the comb and install an adjustment hardware either in wood (matching) or with a black synthetic insert for durability[76]. This is a commonly chosen option (extra cost but nominal relative to the gun's price)[76]. Perazzi offers a variety of stock shapes: e.g. standard Monte Carlo (for trap), parallel comb (for sporting), or field style straight comb (for game guns). Even specialized grips like a "glove grip" can be ordered - this is a custom-fitted pistol grip with a palm shelf, shaped precisely to your hand during a factory visit[77]. In one instance, a customer noted the glove grip option truly made the gun feel molded to them[77]. Forend type is another choice: options include the slim beavertail, broad beavertail (trap style), Schnabel (flared tip common in sporting guns), rounded field forend, or a separated fore-end for side-by-sides (if one were ordering a DC side-by-side)[78]. Perazzi even distinguishes forend mechanism by generations (Type I through Type IV for how the iron attaches) but new guns will all be the latest Type IV. You can select the forend that fits your aesthetic and handling preference[79][80]. Wood grade and finish: Perazzi stocks and forends are made from Turkish/French walnut of high quality by default, but there are graded levels. Typically, Grade 1 is standard (still nice figure), SC2 is an upgrade, SC3 higher, and SCO the top exhibition grade with intense figure. Upgrading wood will add cost, but gives you access to some truly beautiful blanks[81]. Customers who visit the factory can personally select their wood blank from the storeroom (an experience often likened to a kid in a candy store, given the array of walnut)[82][83]. Finish on the wood can be oil, lacquer, or left unfinished (some prefer to have their local specialist finish the oiling)[84][85]. Checkering pattern is standard fine hand-cut, unless a custom pattern is requested. Perazzi also offers custom butt treatment: standard ventilated rubber recoil pad, leather-covered pad, or even a bare checkered wood butt if desired (for game guns). These choices allow the buyer to optimize recoil feel and gun mount.
	o	Aesthetics and Personalization: Aside from the wood, the metal finish and engraving are big choices. Standard Perazzis come in either blued steel or nickel (coin) finish on the receiver[86]. The blued action with simple engraving is classic on lower grade guns; the nickel (silver) action shows off engraving better and resists rust. From there, engraving patterns range widely. The catalog includes preset patterns: e.g. SC3 engraving (often deep scroll and bouquet), SCO engraving (full coverage ornate scroll or game scenes by master engravers), and even higher bespoke one-off engravings. Intricate custom engraving will significantly increase cost and lead time[87]. Some special editions like the High Tech "Platinum" o"  Gold  editions come with unique scrollwork or color inlays and are priced accordingly[88]. Perazzi can inlay gold motifs, engrave the customer's initials or a family crest (monograms), etc. A modern twist offered on High Tech receivers is colored logo lettering - one can choose enamel fill colors for the "Perazzi" logo or model name on the receiver (popular choices are red, gold, black)[89]. They even do national flag inlays on request (e.g. a customer might have an Italian flag or American flag enameled on the bottom of the receiver)[89]. Such personal touches are part of the custom ethos. Small parts can also be gold-plated or jeweled if one desires. Trigger blades can be selectable in shape: standard curved, or a thicker "anatomic" trigger, or a checkered face, etc. (the parts list shows different trigger options and costs)[90]. Essentially, Perazzi will accommodate reasonable cosmetic requests to make the gun uniquely yours.
Despite this dizzying array of options, Perazzi (and their dealers) guide customers through it. Typically, an authorized dealer like in the UK or US will have an order worksheet and expertise to recommend combinations that suit the shooter's goals[91]. For example, a dealer may advise a sporting clays shooter on barrel length and choke based on experience. The buying process often involves consultation, possibly trying demo guns, and then the long wait while the gun is built. Many customers choose to make a pilgrimage to the Perazzi factory during the build - especially to get fitted for the stock once the metalwork is done[92][43]. Perazzi encourages this: they have a dedicated showroom and fitting staff. Visitors are measured with adjustable try-guns, and can select their wood blank on site[93][82]. The factory has an indoor pattern test tunnel and pattern plate, so you can test fire your in-progress gun to confirm it shoots exactly where you want[43]. The stock is then adjusted or remade if needed to fine-tune fit[93][94]. This personalized fitting service (often done by experienced stockmaker Fabrizio in the factory) ensures that when you take delivery, the gun "fits perfectly, like an extension of your body" - a common refrain from Perazzi owners[95]. After final checks, the wood is finished and checkered, and the gun is packaged in your choice of Perazzi case (they even let you pick case color: traditional Perazzi red is popular)[96].
Finally, the completed shotgun is shipped to the dealer or importer, where the customer can pick it up (or have it delivered). It's not uncommon for the entire process, from order to delivery, to take 6-9 months, and occasionally up to a year for highly customized or engraved guns[68]. The company's focus on quality means they won't rush the artisans. But customers consistently report that the wait is worth it - you receive a gun built to your exact specifications, something few manufacturers offer at scale. As one buyer's report said, "the choices are practically endless, which makes every gun unique... each one is hand-finished to a very high standard"[97].
Importantly, most of these custom options (different barrels, ribs, stock dimensions, basic engraving patterns, etc.) are included in the base price. You mainly pay extra for high-grade wood, elaborate engraving, extra barrel sets, or special features like gold inlays or interchangeable sub-gauge tubes. This pricing approach underscores Perazzi's commitment to bespoke service - they want the shooter to get the ideal gun without feeling nickel-and-dimed for every option. In effect, when you buy a Perazzi, you become a gun designer in collaboration with their craftsmen. This level of customization, paired with Perazzi's competition pedigree, is a key reason many top shooters and discerning enthusiasts choose Perazzi over off-the-rack shotguns from other brands. It's an experience not just of buying a gun, but of commissioning a personal piece of sporting equipment that can last a lifetime and even become a family heirloom.
Parts, Accessories, and Service
Owning a Perazzi means you have access to a full catalog of spare parts and accessories to support your shotgun. The company designs its guns to be modular and serviceable - essential for competition guns that fire high volumes of shells. Perazzi provides detailed parts schematics and numbering for every component, and it stocks spare parts through Perazzi USA and authorized dealers worldwide[98][99]. This includes everything from tiny springs and pins to major components like trigger groups and barrels. When ordering parts, owners are advised to provide the part number and the gun's serial number to ensure proper fit[100], as small variations exist between models and generations.
Common Spare Parts: Competitive shooters often keep certain spare parts on hand, especially for guns with removable triggers. High-wear or critical parts include firing pins, firing pin springs, hammer springs (leaf or coil), and ejector springs. Perazzi's parts price list (2024) shows these are relatively affordable: for example, a top or bottom firing pin costs around $77 USD each[101], and small springs (top lever spring, sear spring, etc.) are only about $8-$15 each[102]. A main leaf spring (right or left hammer spring) lists at ~$62[103], reflecting the tempered steel quality. A complete trigger (if one wanted an extra) is more costly - the trigger blade itself is ~$192, and specialty trigger options like anatomic or backwards-curved triggers are ~$384[90]. Ejectors (right or left) cost about $247 each[104]. These prices indicate that while the guns are expensive, maintaining them is not prohibitive; small parts are reasonably priced, and many are user-replaceable. Perazzi even sells parts kits - for instance, a kit might include two firing pins and two springs (leaf or coil) plus a spring tool, popular among trap shooters who travel to shoots[105]. Third-party specialists (like Giuliani in Italy) also make compatible aftermarket parts, but using genuine Perazzi parts is generally recommended to ensure proper metallurgy and fit.
Perazzi publishes exploded diagrams for their trigger groups and receivers, which can be found in the owner's manuals or via the Perazzi USA office. These schematics help gunsmiths or mechanically inclined owners to identify and replace parts as needed. The design's simplicity means many parts can be swapped in minutes: e.g. leaf springs can be changed using a simple hook tool, firing pins by drifting a retaining pin. The detachable trigger can simply be replaced with a spare unit in an emergency (some shooters carry a second trigger group already tuned to their gun - essentially "plug and play" backup). However, major components like barrels or forends are factory-fitted and serialized to the action, so they are not sold as loose aftermarket items without fitting. If one wants an extra barrel set, it must be ordered and fitted by Perazzi (the guns price list is referenced for barrels and forends rather than the parts list)[104][106]. Stocks can be ordered as well, but again some hand-fitting is required to get the inletting perfect.
Accessories: Perazzi offers branded accessories such as guncases, clothing, shooting gear, etc., but more pertinent are functional accessories: e.g. factory comb hardware kits (if you want to retrofit an adjustable comb), choke wrenches ($53)[107], spare trigger springs and tools, stock recoil pads (a factory recoil pad is ~$53[108]), and factory stock bolt wrench. There are also upgrade parts like a selectable trigger conversion kit or an external selector trigger group (allowing barrel selection) - some of these show up in the parts list (e.g. external selector tab, etc.)[109]. Perazzi-branded Negrini cases or leather cases are usually offered when buying the gun; customers often pick the classic red ABS hard case with logo. For travel, many use Perazzi-logo canvas covers, sleeves, etc., which the company sells. The Perazzi shop at the factory and in major shoots carries spare parts and these accessories, so owners can conveniently get what they need at events.
Service and Maintenance: Perazzi shotguns are built to be extremely durable, but like any fine mechanism, they benefit from proper maintenance. The company's guidance includes: keep the action clean and properly lubricated (light gun oil on hinge pins and bite surfaces, grease on the locking bolt, etc.), clean barrels regularly, and avoid storing the gun in damp environments. They note a few unique points: never dry-fire without snap caps (to protect firing pins), release the top lever tension when storing (so the locking bolt spring isn't compressed long-term), and relax hammer springs when storing long-term if possible (not all do this, but with a removable trigger you can leave it fired)[110]. These practices help extend the life of springs and pins.
Perazzi recommends that a qualified gunsmith inspect the gun annually or so (particularly for competition guns)[35]. However, unlike some competitors, they do not mandate a yearly overhaul. Many Perazzi shooters report going many years with only minimal parts replacement. When service is needed, there are factory-authorized service centers (Perazzi USA in Azusa has gunsmiths on staff). Simple repairs like replacing ejector springs or tightening the locking bolt (if the gun starts to loosen after tens of thousands of rounds) can be done at these centers. In the USA, specialist gunsmiths like Giacomo Sporting or Whiz White are well-known for Perazzi work[111]. In Europe, one can always send the gun back to Italy for a refresh. The locking bolt (which engages the barrel lugs) is designed to be replaceable - if the gun wears "off fa"e  (i.e., slight looseness when closed), a new oversized locking bolt can be fitted to restore vault-tight lockup. This is a normal service after very extensive use (e.g. 100k+ rounds). The Perazzi locking bolt part runs a few hundred dollars and is only needed once in a long while[112].
Warranty: Perazzi provides a standard warranty, usually two years from purchase on new guns for the original owner[113]. This covers manufacturing defects in materials or workmanship. In reality, defects are rare, and many issues that might arise (like a broken spring) are considered normal wear and tear and not covered by warranty (similar to tires on a car). The two-year period is relatively short (some makers offer 5 years or longer), but Perazzi's stance is that serious issues will show up early, and beyond that the guns are proven. The company, being smaller, handles warranty claims on a case-by-case basis often with excellent customer service. For example, customers have received personal responses from Mauro Perazzi in resolving technical queries or minor issues[114]. This personal touch somewhat compensates for a formal warranty period.
Perazzi also emphasizes service integrity - meaning if work is needed, it should be done by those who know the guns. They caution that not all local gunsmiths understand the fine tolerances of a Perazzi. Owners are encouraged to use factory or authorized service for anything beyond routine cleaning. The company maintains that with proper care, a Perazzi can last a lifetime of shooting. It's not uncommon to find 40- or 50-year-old Perazzis still in competitive use (with periodically refreshed springs or firing pins). The availability of every part, even for older models, means these guns are never obsolete.
Pricing Structure and Value
Perazzi shotguns occupy the high end of the market, and their pricing reflects the premium craftsmanship and customization. However, given the custom nature, prices can vary widely depending on model, configuration, and added options. Below is an overview of pricing tiers by model and configuration (based on recent retail price lists, effective 2024-2025):
Model / Series
Base Price (USD) Starting at
High-End Versions (with upgrades)
MX8 O/U (Trap/Sporting)
~$13,800 for basic 12ga trap single[115]; ~$20,700 for standard O/U[116]
Up to ~$82,900 for SCO Gold engraved sideplates[117][118] (highest grade engraving + gold inlays)
MX12 O/U (Fixed trigger)
~$22,420 for base Sporting 12ga[119]
Up to ~$83,000 for SCO Gold sideplate version[120] (similar to MX8 since engraving/wood define top price)
MX2000 Series
~$16,640 for MX2000/8 O/U base[121]; ~$23,000 for MX2000S (fixed trigger)[122]
High-grade engraved MX2000 (SC3, SCO) generally priced similarly to MX8 equivalents (e.g. an MX2000 SCO ~ $52k)
High Tech (HT) O/U
~$15,750 base (standard finish, 12ga)[123]
~$49,260 for HT SCO Gold (fully engraved with gold)[124]. Mid-tier: HT SC3 ~$26.7k[123], HT Gold edition ~$23k[123].
High Tech S (Fixed trig.)
~$16,080 base in 12ga[125]
~$49,260 for HTS SCO Gold top-tier[126] (comparable pricing to HT). HTS SC3 around $26.7k[127].
Single Barrel Trap (TM9, etc.)
~$12,600 for TM9 base model[128]; $14,680 for TM9X (with higher rib)[129]
High-rib combo versions (unsingle + O/U barrel sets) can go up to ~$33k (e.g. HT 2020 trap combo)[130]. Single barrels typically top out under $15k unless engraved upgrades are added.
Special Editions & Small Gauges
Pricing similar to equivalent 12ga models, plus surcharges for small gauges or deluxe editions.
E.g. adding a 28ga barrel set to a 12ga adds ~$1,680[31]; a scaled-frame 28ga HTS costs ~$4k extra vs 12ga[31]. Limited editions (like MX8/20, HT 2020 "Palladium") fall in the high-$20k to mid-$30k range.
Notes: These are suggested retail prices (ex-factory). Actual street prices may vary slightly by dealer or include import fees. Base Price usually means a standard grade (no engraving or basic scroll logo, standard wood). Engraving and upgrades significantly increase cost - as seen, an engraved SC3 grade can add $10k-$15k, and SCO grade (full coverage by master engraver) can add $30k+ to the base[131]. Gold inlays and sideplates push it even higher, into the $70k-$80k range for a fully decked out flagship model[117]. Essentially, one could spend from ~$15k for a plain competition Perazzi up to ~$80k for an exhibition-grade masterpiece. Most competition shooters opt for somewhere in the middle (e.g. an MX8 or HT with SC3 engraving and nice wood in the $25k-$40k range).
What's included in the price: Typically, the base price includes the gun built to your specifications with one barrel set, fixed chokes (or choice of constriction), standard stock dimensions or custom dimensions, choice of trigger type, and a factory case. Many custom options are included at no charge - for instance, you can choose any barrel length or rib height without extra fees (except some specialized ribs), get an adjustable comb installed (often at a modest extra charge or included as a "no-cost" option per promotions)[76], and select standard engraving pattern (like minimal scroll or just the Perazzi logo) at no extra cost. Extra-cost options would be: multi-chokes (adding screw-in chokes usually adds a fee, since you get a set of tubes)[132]; premium wood upgrade (SC2, SC3, etc.)[81]; engraving packages beyond basic; extra barrel sets (e.g. buying a 20ga set along with your 12ga barrels); custom finishes like receiver color plating or special coatings; and certain deluxe features (e.g. a glove grip stock might add cost for the extra labor, adjustable buttplate if desired, or things like barrel porting which is an extra service)[133]. These extras are clearly spelled out in Perazzi's price list - for example, a choke tube set might be a few hundred dollars, a selectable trigger might be a few hundred, a high-grade engraving could be tens of thousands.
Wood Grade Pricing: To illustrate, a standard Grade 1 stock is included. Upgrading to SC2 wood might add on the order of $1,000-$1,500. SC3 grade perhaps $2,000-$3,000 more than base. SCO grade (exhibition) could add $5,000 or more, depending on availability of truly exceptional blanks[81]. These are ballpark figures - the exact upcharge is often set by the factory. At a factory visit, if you hand-pick a particularly rare blank, they will quote the surcharge accordingly.
Engraving Pricing: The SC3 engraving pattern (often a fine English scroll) might add roughly $8,000-$12,000 to the price. The SCO pattern (full coverage with perhaps game scenes or deep relief scroll by a named master engraver) could be a $20,000+ upgrade. Adding gold inlay to an SCO pattern (making it "SCO Gold") further increases the price (as seen by the ~$5k jump in price list between SCO and SCO Gold)[117][134]. Sideplates (having a sideplate receiver that gives more engraving canvas) also come at a premium - an MX8 SCO sideplate is listed around $74,800 vs $52,100 for standard boxlock SCO[135]. That difference is largely engraving cost and extra work on the sideplate design. Essentially, engraving is a major factor for collectors or those wanting a functional art piece. Many shooters skip high engraving to keep costs moderate and because a heavily engraved gun might be less worry-free to use in hard competition.
Model Differences and Cost: Interestingly, models with fixed triggers (like MX12, MX2000S, HTS) are priced roughly on par or only slightly above their removable-trigger counterparts in base configuration[119][121]. The choice of removable vs fixed trigger is more about preference than cost. Barrel length or type (unsingle vs O/U vs combo) obviously affects price: Trap combos (one single + one O/U barrel) are significantly more expensive than a single gun. For example, a High Tech trap combo is around $27k base[136], whereas just the single-barrel gun was $15.9k[137]. The combo essentially adds the cost of the second barrel plus fitting. Small gauge frames (28ga or .410 on true scaled-down actions) also cost more - the price list shows an extra charge for 28/.410 on a scaled frame (~$4,380) vs making them on a 12ga frame with sub-gauge barrels (~$1,680)[31]. This reflects the additional machining for a smaller action and different ejectors, etc.
Market positioning: In the luxury shotgun world, Perazzi's pricing is competitive. They are generally more expensive than mass-produced brands like Browning or Beretta's standard line, but less expensive than British "best guns" or certain boutique Italian brands like Fabbri or Piotti (which can run $100k+). For a serious competition shooter, a Perazzi is often seen as a sound investment: it holds value well and can be rebuilt indefinitely. Used Perazzis often sell for high prices, and some limited editions even appreciate. The Blue Book of Gun Values notes that Perazzis have high resale value, especially if well-maintained[138]. The modularity means one could resell a barrel or stock separately, though ideally they are kept as a matching set.
In summary, the pricing structure has a broad range. One can enter the Perazzi world around $12k-$15k (perhaps with a basic model or a good used one) and that gun will perform identically to a $50k version in competition. The higher prices mainly buy aesthetics and personalization. Perazzi's strategy is to give the bespoke gun experience at a semi-production price - thus attracting both hard-core competitors who value function and wealthy enthusiasts who want something exclusive. The company's price lists are transparent: "Prices are intended Ex-Factory and products will be charged at the price applicable at time of delivery."[139] (i.e., if prices update during your wait, the delivery price may reflect that). This is standard for custom orders. Despite the cost, many owners feel the value is justified given the longevity and performance; a well-cared Perazzi can serve across decades of heavy use, and the intangible pride of ownership is a big part of what you pay for, aligning with the brand ethos described earlier.
Events, Community, and Legacy in the Shooting World
Perazzi's influence extends beyond just selling guns - the brand plays an active role in the shooting sports community through events, sponsorships, and an engaged owner network. The company has historically chosen prestige events and unique community-building efforts to maintain its elite image while fostering customer loyalty. Here are some key aspects of Perazzi's involvement in events and the broader community:
	o	The Perazzi Invitational: In recent marketing plans, Perazzi outlined the concept of a Perazzi Invitational - an exclusive shooting event or series reserved for those deeply aligned with the brand's values[140]. Unlike typical sponsored tournaments that are open to many, the Perazzi Invitational is envisioned as "more than an event - it's a declaration of identity", where participation is by merit and brand affinity rather than just entry fee[140]. The idea is to create a prestigious stage for top shooters (and aspiring top shooters) to compete in a setting carefully curated by Perazzi. There would be no clutter of competing logos - only Perazzi in the spotlight - reinforcing the exclusivity. While as of 2025 this Invitational is part of Perazzi's content strategy (linked with the TCN narrative arcs)[141][140], the company has a history of sponsoring unique events (see Perazzi Classic below). If launched, the Perazzi Invitational would likely be an annual championship or high-profile shoot, possibly invitational-only or with qualification through using Perazzi guns in other competitions. It exemplifies Perazzi's approach of "occupying a realm it created exclusively for those who genuinely understand greatness"[140] - in other words, making a competition itself part of the brand mystique. Keep an eye out, as this could become a reality in coming years, serving both as a competition and a marketing showcase for the Perazzi lifestyle.
	o	Grand American & ATA Events: In the American Trap community, Perazzi has long been a prominent name. From 1998 to 2005, Perazzi USA sponsored the Perazzi Classic at the Grand American (the ATA's biggest annual championship)[142]. This was a special handicap event where the top prize was often a new Perazzi shotgun, drawing huge participation. Even after 2005, Perazzi continued presence at the Grand - for example, specific events in the program are labeled "by Perazzi", such as the President Handicap (Event 16) at the 2024 Grand American[143]. This indicates Perazzi sponsors trophies or added money for certain competitions. Additionally, many ATA Hall of Famers (Ray Stafford, Dan Bonillas, etc.) are Perazzi shooters, which further cements the brand's involvement. At the Grand American venue, Perazzi traditionally has a large vendor tent where factory reps and gunsmiths provide service (often Mauro or Roberta Perazzi themselves have attended to meet customers). Perazzi honors trapshooting history too - Daniele Perazzi was inducted into the Trapshooting Hall of Fame in 2019, recognizing his contributions to the ATA sport[144][11]. The Grand America models mentioned earlier were a nod to that community. Through these engagements, Perazzi fosters a loyal following among American trap shooters, who often form a tight-knit subculture exchanging tips on Perazzi tuning and proudly displaying the Perazzi logo.
	o	International Competitions and FITASC: On the global stage, ISSF World Cups, World Championships, and Continental championships frequently see Perazzi as the most-used shotgun. While Perazzi (unlike say Beretta) doesn't plaster its logo on team uniforms due to ISSF rules, the brand quietly benefits from the visibility of winners with their guns. They sometimes host celebratory events for their medalists. In disciplines like FITASC Sporting (international sporting clays) and FITASC Compak, Perazzi shooters like George Digweed, Christophe Auvret, and others have dominated, which in turn has led Perazzi to sponsor certain international sporting events or provide demo guns at venues. In some countries, local distributors run Perazzi Grand Prix shoots - for instance, in the UK or Italy, a "Perazzi Grand Prix" might be held where only Perazzi users compete (or Perazzi provides special prizes). These are not globally publicized, but within national circuits they reinforce community. Live pigeon shoots (although now more niche due to legalities in many places) historically saw Perazzi as a sponsor at prestigious pigeon rings in Europe and South America.
	o	Perazzi Champions Network (Community Storytelling): The earlier-mentioned TCN (The Champions Network) isn't just marketing fluff - it doubles as a community-building exercise. By featuring champions' journeys and perhaps interactive content, Perazzi creates a network of shooters (pros and enthusiasts alike) who engage with the brand story. This can involve online forums, social media groups (there are unofficial but passionate Perazzi owners groups on forums and Facebook), and content sharing that binds the community. Shooters often share pictures of their custom Perazzi or post about factory visit experiences, etc., which the brand encourages. The narrative of joining the "Perazzi family" is reinforced by actual interactions: e.g. Mauro Perazzi answering customer emails personally[145], or factory smiths remembering clients by name on repeat visits. This personal touch makes owners feel part of an exclusive club.
	o	Factory Visits and Customer Events: Visiting the Perazzi factory in Botticino is almost a pilgrimage for enthusiasts. As mentioned, customers who order guns are welcomed to come for fittings and tours. The facility includes not only manufacturing but an on-site shooting range where visitors (by appointment) can shoot trial guns or their finished gun[43]. Perazzi sometimes organizes open days or special sessions for shooting clubs to visit. They also host VIP guests - for instance, during the World Shotgun Championships or World Cup events in Italy, they might host teams at the factory for a tour and dinner. These events deepen customer loyalty. The showroom at the factory is like a mini-museum and store - one can see a display of nearly every model and option (reportedly over lb1 million worth of guns on display)[146][147]. They sell merchandise like jackets, shooting vests, and accessories on site as well[146]. Another tradition: Perazzi family dinners or banquets during major shoots - in some big competitions, Perazzi sponsors a reception for all Perazzi shooters, fostering camaraderie. The brand's representatives (like Perazzi USA staff) attend many regional championships (NSCA Nationals for sporting, National Skeet Championships, etc.) with a vendor booth to provide service and showcase guns. So, the presence is felt widely even outside the Olympics.
	o	Community and Support: The network of authorized dealers and smiths also creates a community. For instance, in the UK, Perazzi's distributor (RUAG/Longthorne in recent years) has "Perazzi fitting days" where shooters can try different demo guns. In the US, some large dealers host Perazzi demo shoots - one can test fire various models side by side. Perazzi encourages this hands-on approach, knowing that the feel of the gun often sells itself. Furthermore, the Perazzi Owner's community is active online: forums like Trapshooters.com and Shotgunworld have entire subforums devoted to Perazzi maintenance, tuning, and showcasing. The company occasionally monitors these to glean feedback.
	o	Sponsored Shooters: Perazzi maintains a roster of sponsored shooters - typically the very top athletes in trap, skeet, and sporting. Unlike some companies that pay large stipends, Perazzi's support might come in the form of providing guns (often multiple guns), custom modifications, and ensuring those shooters have whatever parts or service they need immediately. Olympians like Jessica Rossi or Josip Glasnovi'c have long been associated with Perazzi. The influence of these champions trickles down to local ranges: many aspiring shooters choose Perazzi because their idols won gold with one. Perazzi often publishes interviews or tips from these champions, which is both educational and promotional.
Through all these avenues, Perazzi cultivates an image of a brand that stands with the champions and the passionate enthusiasts. They are not trying to mass-market to every shooter, but those who are serious and appreciate the legacy. The events and community efforts reinforce the notion that buying a Perazzi means joining a prestigious, yet welcoming club - you share a bond with Olympic medalists and dedicated competitors across the world. This community aspect is a powerful asset; as many will say, "Once you shoot a Perazzi and it fits, you become part of the family."
Counterfeit Warnings, Grey Market, and Service Integrity
Because Perazzi guns and parts are valuable, the company is vigilant about protecting customers from counterfeit or unauthorized items, as well as misuse of its modular system. They provide clear warnings and policies to ensure service integrity:
	o	Authenticity of Parts: Perazzi strongly advises owners to purchase parts only from authorized sources (Perazzi USA, factory, or certified dealers) to avoid counterfeit or substandard parts. There have been instances of fake Perazzi parts (such as knock-off firing pins or springs) circulating, as well as third-party "Perazzi-style" parts. These may be cheaper but can have "mixed results" in reliability[148]. Using non-genuine springs, for example, might lead to inconsistent trigger feel or breakages. Additionally, only genuine parts ensure the gun remains in original spec. The company's warranty can be voided if failures are caused by aftermarket parts. Thus, they encourage using the official parts list and even stamping certain parts with identifiable marks.
	o	Grey-Market Guns: A "grey market" Perazzi refers to one that was not imported through official channels or is built from mismatched components. Perazzi USA is the sole importer for the U.S.[149], and similarly each country has an official agent. Guns obtained outside these channels might not carry warranty or service support. Perazzi cautions buyers to be wary of deals "too good to be true" from non-official sellers. Each Perazzi has a serial number that the company can trace to an original sale - warranty service may be refused on guns that bypassed authorized import. More subtly, Perazzi warns that some gunsmiths have built "parts guns" by combining actions and barrels from different Perazzis (because parts are interchangeable to a degree). While the fit may seem okay, these franken-guns can have improper lug engagement or trigger timing issues. Mixing serial-numbered components without proper factory fitting can compromise safety. For example, dropping an older MX8 barrel onto a newer MX8 action might lock up, but the headspace could be off or the ejectors mis-time. Perazzi's stance: always have a qualified smith fit any new barrel to your action and check headspace and point of impact. They serialize barrels, receivers, forends as matched sets at the factory for a reason.
	o	Interchanging Trigger Groups: One unique aspect is that any Perazzi drop-out trigger group will physically lock into any Perazzi receiver of the same type. This interchangeability is helpful in a pinch (e.g., borrowing a friend's trigger if yours breaks in a competition). However, Perazzi cautions that triggers "wear into" their receivers over time. Constant swapping of trigger groups between guns can cause uneven wear on sears or the safety linkage. Also, trigger pulls might vary if a trigger unit is put in a different gun due to minor differences in tolerances. The company line is: it's fine to use a spare trigger in an emergency, but for regular use, each action should have a trigger tuned to it. If you buy a second-hand trigger group, have a smith check its sear engagement in your receiver.
	o	Aftermarket Modifications: Perazzi shotguns are sometimes modified by independent gunsmiths - e.g. adding custom porting, recoil reducers, third-party adjustable comb hardware, or even decorative modifications. While owners are free to customize, Perazzi issues service disclaimers that such modifications can void warranties or future factory service. For instance, if barrels are ported by someone else and later develop a problem, Perazzi may decline to service that barrel (since the integrity was altered). The same goes for lengthening forcing cones, adjusting trigger pulls outside of spec, etc. They caution that any non-factory alteration is at the owner's risk. In particular, converting to release triggers should be done by known experts - Perazzi won't do it at the factory, but they tacitly allow it via recognized specialists. If a release trigger causes an issue, the factory won't cover it.
	o	Counterfeit Guns: Full-on counterfeit Perazzi guns are rare, but not impossible. There have been unverified reports of knock-off copies appearing in places with less regulation. To address this, Perazzi serializes every receiver and barrel and keeps records. A genuine Perazzi will also have proof marks from the Italian proof house in Gardone. The company can authenticate a gun if there's doubt. They also incorporate subtle features in the engraving of logos and numbering that are hard to duplicate. Prospective buyers are advised to purchase through reputable channels to avoid any risk of getting a fake.
	o	Serial Number Integrity: Perazzi's policy is that barrels, receivers, and forends with different serials should only be paired by the factory or authorized agents. While many Perazzi parts can be fitted across guns, doing so might create an unsafe condition if not properly headspaced or if the locking bolt engagement isn't correct. The factory sometimes fits extra barrels to an action (those will bear the same serial with an added suffix mark), but they discourage ad-hoc swapping. They have even printed warnings that using mismatched components "is not recommended and voids any responsibility of the manufacturer." Essentially, if you mix and match and something fails, that's on you. This is especially relevant with trigger groups: older models had slight differences in the interceptor sear design; jamming the wrong generation trigger in could cause doubling or failure to fire. Always consult with Perazzi experts when interchanging parts.
	o	Service by Qualified Personnel: To maintain service integrity, Perazzi trains or authorizes certain gunsmiths. In the U.S., Giacomo Arrighini was the legendary factory-trained smith; others like Lucio Sosta, Doug Gray, etc., are known for Perazzi work. The company's message: these guns are finely fitted, so don't let an amateur hone sears or "" (tinker) with the mechanism. During the warranty period, stick to factory service. After that, use known experts or send it to the factory for any major work (many do send guns to Italy for full refurbishment after years of use). The factory offers full restoration services - reblueing barrels, refinishing wood, recutting checkering, etc., which can make a well-used Perazzi look near-new again. They issue service disclaimers that any gun that's been materially altered by others may be refused for factory service, or they will charge to replace non-factory parts back to original spec. It's a protective stance to ensure quality control.
	o	Grey Import Warnings: Another aspect of grey market is pricing - if someone offers a "new Perazzi" well below list price, it might be an unofficial import (or even stolen). The advice is to buy from the network of authorized dealers to ensure you get the warranty card and proper support. Perazzi USA in Azusa often knows the background of each serial number imported; if you inquire with them about a used gun's serial, they can sometimes confirm its history.
In summary, Perazzi encourages owners to treat their shotgun as the precision instrument it is: use the right parts, don't cut corners on service, and maintain the original integrity. These guns hold their value and performance when properly cared for. The company's warnings about counterfeit/grey products and unauthorized mods are there to protect both the shooter's safety and the brand's reputation. And indeed, part of owning a Perazzi "the right way" is the peace of mind that you have factory-level support and a community of experts to help keep your gun in top condition. As Perazzi positions itself as a lifelong investment, following their guidelines on parts and service ensures your Perazzi will continue to perform for generations - living up to that legendary legacy it carries.
