# Bespoke Journey Narrative

## Overview Copy
- Opening sentence frames the bespoke atelier as "a measured conversation between shooter, craftsman, and time."
- Emphasizes that every build begins with intent (discipline, feel, ritual) before measurements are taken.
- Highlights that Perazzi builds roughly 1,500 guns per year, keeping production intimate.

## Step Modules
1. **Listening Session** – Copy describes remote or in-person interview with the Azusa or Gardone concierge. Inputs: shooting background, competition schedule, body asymmetries, aesthetic preferences.
2. **Measurement & Fitting** – Narrative guides the reader through stock bend, cast, pitch, grip geometry. Mentions traveling master fitters and on-site try-guns. Includes reassurance that adjustments continue until the mount feels inevitable.
3. **Build & Balance** – Explains how barrel regulation, rib selection, trigger spring choice, and wood pairing are choreographed. Notes the weight-balancing lead poured into the forend for sporting builds vs. trap bias toward between-the-hands mass.
4. **Artistry & Finishing** – Talks about engraving studios, wood oiling cycles, personalization options (initials, crest, champion engravings) with caution that everything is done by approved artisans.
5. **Delivery & Stewardship** – Sets expectation for final fitting, pattern testing, and the lifetime service partnership.

## Proof Points
- Snippets from champion testimonials (Wendell Cherry, Kim Rhode) referencing collaborative design.
- Quote block: "A Perazzi fitting feels less like a transaction and more like being read by someone who understands shooters better than they understand themselves."
