# Heritage & History – Related & Final CTA

## G. Related Reading *(reuse `RelatedList`)*
**Purpose:** Link to longform articles (e.g., “The Making of MX8,” factory visit narratives, interviews).  
**Fields:** `Article[]` — title, excerpt, slug, hero image.  
**Motion/Perf/A11y:** Fade‑up; lazy images; card `<a>` semantics; prefetch on focus/hover; 4.5:1 contrast.

## H. Final CTA — “Visit the Factory / Begin Your Fitting” *(reuse `CTASection`)*
**Purpose:** Close with an invitation into the living story.  
**Primary:** **Request a Visit** → Experience / Visit  
**Secondary:** **Begin Your Fitting** → Bespoke Build  
**Motion/A11y/Perf:** As in prior sections; prefetch routes; strong contrast; large tap targets; visible focus.
