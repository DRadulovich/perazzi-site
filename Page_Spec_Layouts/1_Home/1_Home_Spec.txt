Perazzi Home – Component Architecture & Interaction Spec
Purpose & Emotional Arc
The Perazzi Home page quietly invites the visitor into a journey of mastery and legacy. In a single scroll, it progresses from a hushed invitation through immersion in craft and heritage, toward a personal revelation of belonging – culminating in a confident call to join the legacy. Each act deepens emotional resonance, moving from intrigue to conviction with the brand’s trademark calm authority[1].
Component Stack (Top → Bottom)
Hero Banner (Act I – “Invitation”)
Purpose: Establish a first impression of quiet prestige and invite exploration. It whispers the brand’s core identity – Perazzi as a life-defining companion – not just a shotgun, but an identity[2].
Content Fields: Tagline (e.g. a timeless mantra like “Quiet monuments to greatness.”[3]), optional subheading, background media (full-bleed image or ambient video), and a discreet scroll indicator (icon).
Interaction Notes: No user interaction required beyond scrolling. A subtle down-arrow cue encourages scrolling. The header text is centered and remains static until the user scrolls, then gracefully scrolls out to reveal the next act.
Motion Grammar: Fade-in of tagline on page load (using ease-out, 700ms) once LCP image is loaded. Background image may have a slow parallax drift on scroll for depth. Trigger: on page load for text; parallax on scroll (disabled if prefers-reduced-motion).
Image/Video Guidelines: Use a high-quality image or looped video that conveys mood (e.g. low light gleam off engraved steel or an artisan’s hands on walnut wood). Optimize with next/image for responsive sizes. Video (if used) should be short, muted, and preload a poster frame. Ensure composition keeps important content away from edges (to avoid overlap with UI) and includes a focal point for LCP[4].
Performance Notes: The hero’s background media is the expected Largest Contentful Paint element, so it must load fast (target LCP ≤ 2.5s[4]). Use preconnect to CDN, and <link rel="preload"> for the hero image. Reserve the image’s space to prevent layout shift (target CLS ≤ 0.05, well within the 0.1 threshold for stability[4]).
Accessibility Checklist: All text overlays have sufficient contrast against the background (minimum 4.5:1). Provide descriptive alt text for background image (or use as decorative with empty alt if purely aesthetic). Ensure the scroll indicator is keyboard-focusable if interactive (or aria-hidden if purely decorative). Heading text is marked up as an <h1> for proper page structure.
Craftsmanship Timeline (Act II – “Immersion in Craft”)
Purpose: Immerse users in Perazzi’s sacred craftsmanship journey, highlighting that each gun is custom-built as a personal legacy, not a product[5]. This section educates through storytelling – showing the bespoke build process as a ritual of excellence.
Content Fields: A sequence of “fitting stage” entries from the CMS (each with a title, rich description, and a media asset). For example: Stage 1 – Measurement & Fit, Stage 2 – Engraving the Soul, Stage 3 – Proof & Legacy, etc., drawn from the Sanity dataset of fitting stages. Each stage has an associated Factory asset (photo or video) illustrating that step.
Interaction Notes: Implements an interactive scroller. As the user scrolls, each stage triggers in sequence: text content fades in and images/video transition. On desktop, a pinned scroll is used – the section fixes in place while stages overlay one another. On mobile (where pinning can be clunky), it gracefully degrades to a simple stacked sequence (each stage occupying its own scroll space).
Motion Grammar: Scroll-driven reveal of each stage. Trigger each new stage when it reaches mid-viewport (using Intersection Observer). Use a consistent easing (e.g. ease-in-out) for opacity and transform animations. For example: as Stage 1 enters, its image zooms slightly (scale 1 → 1.05) and text rises into view (Y translation 20px to 0) with 600ms ease-out. As the user continues, Stage 2 then overlays, etc. Previous stages may fade away or scroll up out of view to maintain focus on the current narrative.
Image/Video Guidelines: A Perazzi gunsmith inspects a barrel by eye, exemplifying hand-fitted precision. Use authentic factory visuals (tagged FactoryAsset in CMS) for each stage – e.g. master engravers at work, walnut stocks being shaped, barrels forged. Each media must be optimized (next/image for photos, or lightweight MP4/WebM for short clips). Prefer static images for slower connections. All media includes descriptive captions/alt text (e.g. “Artisan straightening barrels by sight”) to reinforce storytelling for screen readers.
Performance Notes: Load media progressively. Use lazy-loading (loading="lazy") for stage images beyond the first to avoid straining LCP. Ensure pinned-scroll script yields no jank: offload heavy calculations outside the main thread (use CSS position: sticky and hardware-accelerated transforms where possible). Test that adding stages doesn’t introduce layout shifts (each stage container has fixed dimensions in CSS). Memory management: if using videos, unload or pause offscreen videos to save resources.
Accessibility Checklist: All stage content is accessible in DOM order (even if visually overlaid). If JavaScript is off or prefers-reduced-motion is on, the timeline displays as a simple series of sections – all text and images visible, in logical reading order. Provide a skip link before this section to allow keyboard users to jump past the scroller if needed. Ensure focus management: if any interactive elements exist within (e.g. a “learn more” link on a stage), they are reachable and don’t get trapped during scroll animations. Color contrast is checked for any text over images (overlay scrims may be used to guarantee contrast).
Champion Marquee (Act III – “Legacy & Belonging”)
Purpose: Connect the brand’s legacy to human stories. This section serves as a marquee story highlight – demonstrating that owning a Perazzi places you in the lineage of champions and aficionados[6]. It provides an emotional revelation: Perazzi is not just a gun, it’s joining a storied family.
Content Fields: Featured Champion content – e.g. a champion shooter or legacy owner profile. Fields include name/title (e.g. Olympic Gold Medalist), a brief quote or insight (“A Perazzi is not something you own, it’s something you become.”[3]), and a portrait or action photo. Optionally, a link to “Read full story” (Article from The Champions Network) if applicable.
Interaction Notes: Primarily a static display with an emphasis on text and imagery. No complex interaction; the user simply scrolls into it. However, on hover or tap, the quote text may subtly animate (e.g. a gentle highlight or scroll-up effect) to draw attention to key phrases. If a “read more” CTA is present, it appears as an underlined link or button, focusable via keyboard.
Motion Grammar: Soft, cinematic effects to maintain focus on the story. The champion image might fade in (delay 100ms after section enters viewport, duration ~500ms). The quote text could have a slight delay and fade/slide in (e.g. from bottom with ease-out). Use the same easing as other sections (ease-in-out for consistency). Ensure motion is minimal and respectful – a slow reveal that matches the quiet authority tone (no flashy zooms or fast swipes).
Image/Video Guidelines: The featured photograph should be high-resolution and impactful – for example, a champion in action or a timeless portrait. If the image contains the person’s face, do not overlay excessive text on it to preserve dignity and focus. Maintain a consistent aspect ratio so layout doesn’t shift. Use next/image with proper placeholder="blur" to avoid jarring loads. Provide alt text without naming the individual (e.g. “Champion shooter poised to fire, embodying calm confidence”), in line with privacy guidelines.
Performance Notes: This section’s content is not LCP-critical, but it should still be optimized. The image should be served in an appropriate size for the viewport (responsive sizes via next/image). Since it’s mid-page, it can be lazy-loaded, but with a low threshold so it loads just before scrolling into view (to avoid user seeing a blank). The text is static HTML (no heavy scripts). Any hover animation is done via CSS for performance.
Accessibility Checklist: Ensure the quote is marked up (could be a <blockquote> with proper <cite> if naming the champion, or just a paragraph with aria-label context). The champion’s name or title should be text, not baked into an image, for screenreader readability. If a link to an article or profile exists, its purpose is clear (e.g. “Read John Doe’s Story” – with aria-label if necessary to include context like “Read champion’s full story”). As always, text contrast against the background (which might be a dark overlay on the image) should be ≥ 4.5:1.
Finale CTA Section (Act IV – “Join the Legacy”)
Purpose: Conclude the emotional arc with a culmination – a quiet yet powerful call-to-action. It affirms the visitor’s sense of belonging and prompts them to take the next step (e.g. begin a bespoke order or explore dealers). This section crystallizes the brand promise: “Owning a Perazzi transcends possession – it becomes a profound affirmation of your rightful place within an enduring legacy.”[7]
Content Fields: Closing statement text (1–2 sentences in the Perazzi voice, e.g. a refined challenge or invitation), and a prominent CTA button. The CTA text might be “Begin Your Journey” or “Build Your Perazzi” – phrased as an initiation rather than a sales push. Background can be a solid elegant color or a subtle image that doesn’t distract (could be a dark textured backdrop echoing gun metal or wood grain).
Interaction Notes: The CTA button is keyboard and screenreader focusable, and its hover/focus states are clearly styled (e.g. underline or slight brightness increase). Scrolling here triggers an analytics event (final act viewed). The only interaction expected is clicking or activating the CTA, which should smoothly route the user (e.g. to a configurator or contact page). Ensure the button has a large hit area for easy tapping on mobile.
Motion Grammar: Minimal but impactful. As this section scrolls into view, the background might fade from the previous section to a solid color (transition via CSS, no jarring change). The text can fade-up on enter (use the standard ease-out, ~500ms). The CTA button might appear with a slight delay after the text, emphasizing it. Avoid any looping or continuous animation – the goal is a calm finale.
Image/Video Guidelines: If using an image backdrop, keep it subtle (low-contrast, perhaps a blurred vignette of the Perazzi logo or a champion trophy) to ensure overlaid text and button pop. Often a simple dark background with a faint texture works best to maintain contrast. All imagery must have alt text or be marked decorative appropriately.
Performance Notes: Very lightweight – mostly text and a button. Ensure that any background image here is either a reused image (likely cached) or a very small file. This section should load by the time the user reaches it (preload if necessary when near viewport). The CTA should be immediately responsive on click – prefetch the linked page with Next.js for instant navigation.
Accessibility Checklist: The CTA button uses an appropriate ARIA role (default <button> or <a role="button"> if linking) and label. It meets contrast requirements (both default and on hover/focus state). Verify that ending the page here is logical for screenreader flow – e.g., no hidden content follows. If multiple locales are supported, ensure the CTA link can route to the locale-specific page or carries the locale context. Finally, ensure focus is visible when the user tabs to the button (Tailwind focus styles or Radix UI focus ring as needed).
Data Bindings
The Home page pulls structured content from Sanity CMS, using these data bindings to ensure dynamic, up-to-date content: - Platform/Frame: (Underlying product model data) – Not explicitly shown on Home, but available for context. Hero or narrative content can be filtered or tailored by platform (e.g. showcasing the MX series heritage in imagery). If needed, the CMS could flag which platform a featured gun or story involves, but on this page the messaging stays high-level (transcending any single model). - Discipline: (Shooting discipline like Trap, Skeet, Sporting) – Used implicitly to give context to champions or stories. For example, the featured Champion might have a discipline attribute (Olympic Trap), which could be mentioned in their title or alt text. The page doesn’t list all disciplines outright, but discipline can influence which champion story is shown (e.g. rotating between sporting clays vs. trap champions to appeal to different audiences). - Gauge: (Shotgun gauge, e.g. 12ga, 20ga) – Not directly presented on the Home page (since technical specs are de-emphasized in favor of narrative). However, gauge could tag media assets or stories (for instance, a .410 gauge youth champion story) if the content strategy requires. The architecture allows filtering content by gauge for other pages or future personalization. - Grade: (Gun grade/engraving level) – Also not directly shown here. It’s a part of product detail (engraving or wood grade), but on Home any references to opulence or craftsmanship are narrative, not labeled by grade. Still, if an image of a finely engraved receiver is used, it might be tagged in CMS with its grade (e.g. SCO custom) to ensure we display the highest craftsmanship. The component just treats it as an image; specifics are left to context or caption rather than explicit labels. - Fitting Stage: (Bespoke fitting/build process steps) – Used in the Craftsmanship Timeline. The timeline component binds to an ordered list of fitting stages from CMS. Each stage entry provides copy and a Factory asset. For example, Stage 1 might correspond to the stock fitting session (with content describing the try-gun and measurements[8]), Stage 2 to hand engraving, etc. These entries populate the timeline dynamically so content editors can tweak the narrative without code changes. - Champion: (Champion shooter or legacy figure profiles) – Used in the Champion Marquee. The featured champion’s data (name, title, quote, image) is pulled via a reference to a Champion document in CMS. This ensures the homepage can feature a current or significant figure (e.g. an Olympian or world champion) and be easily updated. The Champion schema likely links to related Articles (stories, interviews), enabling that “Read more” link if desired. - Factory Asset: (Media from the Perazzi factory or workshops) – Used in Hero and Craft sections. These are high-quality photos/videos tagged in CMS as factory shots (crafting barrels, fitting stocks, the Botticino workshop, etc.). The Hero might use a factory asset (e.g. a master gunsmith at work) to set an authentic tone. Each timeline stage definitely uses a Factory asset to visualize that step. Data binding ensures that if these assets are updated or optimized in CMS, the site pulls the latest (with next/image auto-refreshing on build). - Article: (Long-form content pieces, e.g. from The Champions Network or blog) – May be used to enrich storytelling. On Home, this appears if the champion’s quote is excerpted from an article, or if a CTA is included to read a full article. In that case, the Article document provides the URL slug and title so the “Read full story” link can be generated. The architecture supports pulling in an Article teaser (title or summary) if we ever feature a standalone editorial teaser on the home page. Currently, the usage is limited to supporting the champion highlight.
State & Variation
Mobile vs. Desktop: The layout and behaviors adapt responsively. On desktop, the Hero fills the viewport with centered text; on mobile, the text is slightly smaller and may stack tighter to avoid overwhelming a small screen (still maintaining padding for breathing room). The Craftsmanship timeline on desktop uses a pinned scroll with split-screen (e.g. text on left, image on right) or an overlay technique; on mobile, it becomes a vertical stack with full-width images and text above or below each image for sequential flow. Interactive hover effects (like subtle image zooms) are replaced with tap-triggered or automatic alternatives on touch devices. All interactive targets (buttons, links) have adequate size on mobile (e.g. 44px minimum height) and use mobile-friendly UI controls. The page is tested for cross-browser consistency, ensuring that Safari/iOS (which may handle sticky and viewport units differently) still gets a smooth experience.
Reduced-motion Mode: The experience honors prefers-reduced-motion. When this setting is detected, all non-essential animations are turned off or simplified. The narrative timeline will not “pin” or animate stages; instead, each stage simply appears as the user scrolls (or even all content could be immediately visible in a static column). Transitions like fade-ins are either removed or changed to instant visibility to avoid motion. Critical highlights (like revealing content) might use a simple CSS fade with prefers-reduced-motion: reduce media query to make it essentially instantaneous. The goal is that users who opt out of motion still get all the content in a calm, accessible way – just without parallax or fancy timing.
Locale Variants: The page is prepared for internationalization via next-intl. All text content (taglines, descriptions, quotes, button labels) is either sourced from localized CMS fields or translation dictionaries. The design accommodates text expansion for languages other than English (for instance, a German or Italian translation of the tagline might be longer). We ensure that headings and components can handle different character sets and directions. (If a right-to-left locale is added, we would use CSS logical properties or a [dir="rtl"] strategy to flip layouts appropriately – though for Latin-based languages this isn’t needed.) Any images with embedded text would need localized variants, but currently the home design avoids text-in-image. The language switcher (in the site header) can swap the locale, reloading the page content in the chosen language without breaking layout. Typography choices (web fonts) support the character sets of target locales.
Light vs. Dark Section Backgrounds: The homepage features both light and dark background sections to create contrast between acts. Components are designed with theme-aware styles. For example, the Hero might use a dark overlay on an image (dark section, light text), the Craft timeline might alternate (text on light background for readability, or use dark backgrounds behind text depending on imagery), the Champion marquee could be on a dark faded photo with white text, and the finale CTA might return to a simple dark background with light text. Each component explicitly supports a background color mode prop (e.g. theme="dark" or theme="light") to switch text and UI element colors. We adhere to contrast needs: e.g. on dark background, use white or light gray text; on light background, use near-black text. Interactive elements also adjust (for instance, buttons on dark might use a light outline or invert style). These background variations are baked into the design system tokens (Tailwind classes for dark section styles vs. light). No matter the mode, we verify that every element remains legible and that there are no sudden style clashes when transitioning between sections (smooth transitions or a dividing element help the eye adjust).
Tech Notes & Fallbacks
Framework: Built with Next.js (App Router, React 18) – leveraging server-side rendering and static generation for optimal performance. The Home page uses Next’s App Router conventions (React Server Components where feasible for static content like text, and Client Components for interactive pieces like the animated scroller). This ensures initial content is indexable and loads fast, while dynamic behavior hydrates seamlessly on the client.
Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling consistent with the Perazzi design system. Tailwind’s config encodes brand colors (deep reds, rich blacks, muted golds) and font choices, ensuring consistency across breakpoints and dark/light section variants. We use Tailwind’s responsive and motion-safe utilities for quick adaptations (e.g. md:text-xl, motion-reduce:transition-none).
UI Components: Radix UI primitives underlie interactive elements to guarantee accessibility and consistency. For example, if the scroll indicator is a custom button, Radix provides focus management. Any popovers or dialogs (not heavily used on Home) would come from Radix for a11y. The CTA button might be a Radix <Button> or custom styled, still ensuring proper semantics. Radix also assists with things like manageable focus outlines and keyboard navigation patterns out of the box.
CMS & Data: Content is sourced from Sanity CMS via its Content Lake. The Home page components query Sanity at build time (using GROQ or Sanity’s GraphQL) for the necessary fields (texts, images, references). We utilize Sanity’s preview mode in development to live-refresh changes. Data types like Platform, Champion, Article, etc., correspond to Sanity schemas; the front-end is built to gracefully handle missing or optional fields (e.g. if no champion story is set, that section could be skipped or use a default brand message).
Images & Media: Using Next/Image with a Cloudinary loader (via Vercel integration). All images are served in modern formats (WebP/AVIF) with automatic resizing. Cloudinary’s CDN ensures global delivery and on-the-fly optimizations (like DPR scaling). We set up responsive srcset so that mobile devices get smaller images. For video content, we host through Cloudinary or Vercel’s static storage and use HTML5 video with preload controls. Fallback posters and accessibility attributes (aria-media-currentTime for captions if needed) are considered.
Hosting & Deployment: Deployed on Vercel, benefiting from its Edge Network and Functions. The page is likely statically generated and cached, with revalidation on content changes. Vercel’s build optimizations (like automatic code-splitting) keep the homepage bundle lean. We also use their analytics for basics and error tracking.
Animation: Implemented via Framer Motion for React, providing a robust animation API for orchestrating the scroll-based narrative. Framer Motion’s variants and controls allow us to sequence the stage reveals in the timeline with precise timing. Simpler effects (like a hover state or a basic fade) might use CSS or the Web Animations API for minimal overhead. We carefully balance using JavaScript for complex synced animations and CSS transitions for straightforward ones. All animations are designed with a fallback mindset: if the Framer Motion library fails to load or JS is disabled, content still appears (maybe without animation, but in correct order).
Motion Fallbacks: If prefers-reduced-motion is detected or if JS-driven animation fails, we default to CSS-only styling. For instance, the Hero tagline will just be visible (no fade-in), the timeline will use CSS :target or simple block display of each stage, etc. We have CSS media queries to disable transition properties for users who opted out of motion. The critical content reveal (like showing each stage) can be done with :intersection-observer polyfill or simply no transition if needed. This ensures no critical information is ever locked behind an animation – it’s all in the DOM.
Internationalization: Handled by next-intl (or Next’s built-in i18n routing). Text is output in the user’s locale; we load locale-specific JSON files or fetch Sanity content with localization. We test that switching languages properly updates all text and that the structure remains consistent (no broken layouts due to longer strings). Dates or numbers (if any were on the page, e.g. a stat or year) would be formatted via i18n as well, though the homepage mainly deals in prose.
Analytics: We integrate an analytics solution (e.g. Google Analytics 4 or a privacy-conscious alternative) to track user engagement. We track scroll depth – for a narrative page like this, we specifically fire events when the user enters each act (using the intersection observers on the sections to trigger events like HeroSeen, CraftStagesSeen, ChampionStorySeen, FinalCTASeen). We also track CTA interactions: when the user clicks the final “Begin Your Journey” button (or any in-page link like a champion story), an event logs the click and target. Visibility metrics: we monitor when the CTA section becomes visible (as a proxy for reading completion rate). Web vitals are instrumented – using Vercel/Next’s built-in analytics or web-vitals package – to collect LCP and CLS data in the real world (e.g. sending an analytics event with LCP time once it occurs, so we can ensure our target <2.5s is met for most users). All tracking respects user privacy (e.g. honoring Do Not Track, and not collecting personal data).
No-Regrets Checklist
Performance (Core Web Vitals): The page is optimized to consistently hit LCP under 2.5s and CLS below 0.05. Hero media is preloaded and uses efficient formats; all images have width/height attributes or CSS aspect-ratio boxes to prevent layout shifts. We continuously test these metrics (using Lighthouse and WebpageTest) and will adjust content or technique if any regression threatens these budgets.
Contrast & Legibility: All text meets at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio against its background, satisfying WCAG AA for normal text. This includes text over images (which are darkened or lightened via overlays to ensure contrast). We double-check small text like captions or button labels for compliance. The chosen font sizes and weights are legible on various screens (avoiding ultra-light weights on low-contrast backgrounds, for instance).
Keyboard Navigation: Every interactive component is reachable and operable via keyboard. We test tab order through the page: it flows logically from the main navigation (header) into the hero CTA (if any), through any links in the timeline or champion section, and finally to the final CTA button, then to footer links. Visible focus styles are present on all focusable elements (using default browser outlines or custom styles that are highly visible). There are no keyboard traps – e.g. if a carousel or custom scroll area were present, it would allow normal tab escape. For long sections (like the timeline), a skip link is provided to jump to the next section to aid keyboard users.
Images Alt Text: All imagery on the homepage has appropriate ALT text. Decorative images are either given empty alt or CSS backgrounds so they’re ignored by screen readers. Informative images (like the craftsman photo or champion portrait) have descriptive alt text conveying the content and emotional tone (without assuming user can see it). We avoid exposing any text in images without also providing it in alt or nearby copy.
Localization & Language Switching: The page is fully locale-ready. Copy is managed via translation keys or localized fields; no hard-coded strings that would be missed in translation. The language switcher (available in the site header) can toggle languages – the home page has been tested to ensure layout accommodates the longest expected translations. All <html> attributes update lang accordingly for screen readers. We also account for cultural nuances in imagery if needed (though the core narrative is universal, we could swap a featured champion to one known in a given region via CMS if desired).
Analytics Events: Key user events are logged for insight and optimization. We fire an event when the user scrolls into each act (so we know how far they typically engage – e.g., “Act II seen” means they reached the craft timeline). The final CTA visibility is tracked (so we know what % see the call-to-action). CTA clicks are tracked with an event label (e.g. cta_home_begin_journey_click). Additionally, any interaction with the narrative scroller beyond just scrolling (if we had, say, a user clicking through stages manually or pausing a video) would be captured. These events feed into dashboards to verify engagement with our story (e.g. if many drop off before Act III, we might refine content). All events are non-personal and aggregated.
Progressive Enhancement: The page is robust even if advanced features fail. If the fancy scrolling animations don’t load, the content still appears in order. If the user is on an older browser, they still get the basic content (we include necessary polyfills for Intersection Observer, etc., or fall back to simpler behavior). No critical message is conveyed only through color or animation – we use text and semantic structure to ensure the story is received under any conditions.
Test & QA: We’ve run through a “no-regrets” pre-launch QA: testing on slow networks (to check LCP), testing with images off (to ensure alt texts make sense), using screen readers on the narrative to ensure it’s logical, and simulating various user settings (zoom text to 200%, high contrast mode, etc.). The page delivers a graceful, compelling experience for every user, in alignment with Perazzi’s timeless, exacting standards.
