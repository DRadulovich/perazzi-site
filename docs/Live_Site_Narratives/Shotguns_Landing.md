# Shotguns Landing Narrative

## Hero Promise
- Headline tone: "Every target, every story, begins with balance between hands." The hero copy frames the page as the gateway to the entire Perazzi competition lineup.
- Subheading reinforces craftsmanship meets discipline-specific intent and invites users to pick the discipline tile that mirrors how they shoot.
- Background visual: slow pan of the Gardone factory benches with copper light, emphasizing hand shaping and the removable trigger assembly resting on linen.

## Trigger Explainer Module
- Short paragraph demystifying the dropout trigger: why removable groups matter for serious competitors (serviceability between rounds, spring selection, reliability under travel).
- Diagram callouts for coil vs. flat springs and the safety block; annotated numbers correspond to interactive hotspots on the live page.
- CTA: "See how master fitters configure your trigger" linking to bespoke experience.

## Discipline Hubs
Each tile follows a predictable pattern so retrieval models can cite the right one when users self-identify. Fields to ingest:
1. **American Trap / ATA** – Focus on MX2000/RS, TM9X, DB81 combos; copy stresses tall ribs, responsive stocks, and the Grand American lineage.
2. **International Trap / Bunker** – Highlights MX12, High Tech 2020 bunker configurations, emphasis on fast recovery, Olympic lineage callouts.
3. **Sporting & FITASC** – Mix of High Tech S small-gauge sets and MX12 SCO; language around balance through long targets and how Perazzi tunes for complex presentations.
4. **Skeet** – Mentions MX2000/8, MX8/20, focus on fast handling, consistent swing weight, champion quotes.
5. **Live Bird / Helice** (if present) – Notes tradition, high rib stability, bespoke engraving stories.
- Each tile includes: summary paragraph, featured champion image + quote, link to the appropriate platform deep dive.

## Material Story Tiles
- Engraving vignette: macro video still of bulino shading; copy explains grade progression and how stories can be told through metal.
- Wood vignette: detail of exhibition walnut blank, referencing how density and veining influence feel and echo the owner’s personality.
- Both tiles funnel toward bespoke scheduling CTA.
