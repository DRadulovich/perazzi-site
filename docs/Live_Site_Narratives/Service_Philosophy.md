# Service & Stewardship Narrative

## Hero Statement
- "Every Perazzi deserves hands that understand its heartbeat." Sets expectation that service is proactive, reverent, and always through authorized centers.
- Background image: receiver disassembled on felt, artisans polishing sears.

## Core Messages
- Preventive maintenance cadence (every 50k shells for competition guns, annual check for high-volume shooters).
- Philosophy that the concierge can coordinate travel crates to Gardone or route to regional master gunsmiths trained by Perazzi USA.
- Emphasis on genuine parts: coil/flat springs tempered in-house, regulated barrels kept matched to their serials.
- Warranty framing: authenticity verification, documentation needed, disclaimers about aftermarket modifications voiding coverage.

## Service Pathways
1. **Factory Refresh** – Outline of steps: concierge booking, inbound inspection, mechanical reset (timing, locking surfaces, ejector tuning), cosmetic touch-up if requested.
2. **Authorized Gunsmith Network** – Mirror data from Recommended_Service_Centers but add persona copy about each (e.g., "Cole Fine Guns – Naples: specialists in High Tech competition rebuilds").
3. **Event-Based Support** – On-site service vans at Grand American, Nationals, FITASC majors. Mention ability to pre-book tune-ups.

## Owner Guidance Blocks
- Wood care fundamentals (oil, humidity, travel cases) referencing official text.
- Trigger group stewardship: how to transport, when to swap springs, why not to self-polish sear faces.
- FAQ snippet on mixing components: remind owners that serial harmony matters and factory must re-time combos.
