# **INCORRECT** LIST OF **PERAZZI AUTHORIZED DEALERS** RESPONSE

## PROMPT:

```OK, I really like everything that you just said now what I would like for you to do is organize a message that has a couple different sections in it. The first section would be what my filter and intentions are that I’m using for this custom order the next section would be all of the decisions that I have already made in terms of the spec. The next section would be all of the decisions that are highly narrowed down, but not specifically chosen yet the next section would be all of the decisions that are currently open ended and then the last section would be a list of maybe the three closest dealers to Houston Texas as well as any places that Perazzi will be at themselves that are either close to me or coming up soon in the calendar
```

---

## RESPONSE:

```Certainly. Here’s a structured summary of your custom Perazzi build journey, organized as you requested. This will serve as a clear, actionable reference for both you and your dealer or fitter.

---

## 1. **Your Filter & Intentions**

You are a Master Class NSCA competitor seeking a shotgun as a pure tool—optimized for high-level sporting clays performance, not aesthetics. Your priorities are:
- **Absolute precision and control** in barrel movement and point of impact.
- A gun that “disappears” in the hands—neither overtly lively nor ponderous, but perfectly neutral.
- Minimal decision-making during competition: “set and forget” reliability, especially regarding chokes and configuration.
- Fit and balance tailored to your stature (6’3”, 220 lbs) and competitive demands.
- Aesthetics are unimportant; all choices are made for functional performance.

---

## 2. **Decisions Already Made**

- **Platform:** Perazzi MX8 Sporting (primary), with High Tech Sporting as a secondary consideration if more mass is desired.
- **Primary Use:** Sporting Clays (NSCA competition).
- **Barrel System:** Fixed chokes (for consistency and simplicity).
- **Balance Philosophy:** Neutral to slightly forward, with the balance point just ahead of the hinge pin.
- **Aesthetics:** Minimal engraving, standard wood, oil or matte finish—function over form.
- **Side Ribs:** Standard ventilated.

---

## 3. **Decisions Narrowed Down, Pending Final Choice**

- **Barrel Length:**  
  - 32" (default), 34" (if desired for more stability), or custom intermediate length (e.g., 33") if available.
- **Barrel Weight/Profile:**  
  - Medium/standard profile for “invisible” handling; avoid extremes.
- **Rib Style:**  
  - Flat or semi-high rib, with a slight preference for flat unless a fitter advises otherwise.
- **Choke Constrictions:**  
  - Likely Light Modified (LM) and Improved Modified (IM), but open to final fitting/testing.
- **Stock Fit:**  
  - Dimensions to be finalized at a professional fitting session; adjustable comb optional but recommended for future flexibility.

---

## 4. **Decisions Still Open**

- **Exact barrel length** (pending availability and further testing).
- **Precise choke constrictions** (to be confirmed after further discussion or patterning).
- **Grip and forend style** (standard sporting is likely, but can be refined at fitting).
- **Trigger blade shape and bead type** (to be discussed with dealer/fitter).
- **Any small ergonomic or handling tweaks** that may arise during the fitting process.
