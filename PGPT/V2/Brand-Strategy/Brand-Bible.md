### 3.2 Product Platform Architecture

#### 3.2.1 Platform Overview

If you are comparing MX vs High Tech vs TM vs DC vs SHO, start here for the platform-level mechanical and handling differences.

All Perazzi shotguns derive from the **MX-style low-profile O/U action**, extended into several families:[16][18]

- **MX Platform (O/U)**  
  - Low-profile receiver; Boss-derived locking; monobloc barrels; interchangeable O/U barrel sets.  
  - Removable-trigger models (e.g. MX8) and fixed-trigger derivatives (e.g. MX12, MX2000S).  
  - Basis for most trap, skeet, sporting, and live-pigeon builds.

- **High Tech Platform (HT / HTS)**  
  - Widened receiver adds 3–4 ounces between the hands for improved balance and recoil management.[18][19]  
  - **High Tech (HT)**: removable trigger; **High Tech S (HTS)**: fixed trigger.  
  - Offered in 12 gauge and scaled small-gauge frames (20/28/.410).

- **TM Platform (Single Barrel)**  
  - Single-barrel trap guns (TM1, TMX, TM9, TM9X).  
  - Designed for ATA singles/handicap and similar disciplines.  
  - Typically fixed triggers with high combs and specialized ribs.

- **DC Platform**  
  - Side by side double gun with detachable trigger group using coil mainsprings for rugged, high-volume use.

- **SHO Platform (Sidelock)**  
  - Sidelock designs with removable triggers; more aligned with traditional high-art gunmaking.

The core philosophy: **one fundamental action geometry**, many configurations tuned to discipline, gauge, balance, and aesthetic preferences.

#### 3.2.2 MX Series – General O/U Family

- **MX designation**: Covers most O/U competition guns from MX1 upwards.[16][17]
- **MX8** – Archetypal removable-trigger 12-gauge O/U introduced in the 1960s, still a major benchmark.  
- Small-gauge models: **MX20** (20ga), **MX28** (28ga), **MX410** (.410).  
- models like **MX3**, **MX3 Special**, **MX5**, **MX7**, and **MX9** represent different stock and barrel configurations, economy/fixed-trigger options, or era-specific tweaks.
- **MX12** – Fixed-trigger derivative of MX8 using coil springs; marketed as simpler and slightly lighter while maintaining the same handling.[16]  
  - **MX2000S**: MX2000 styling with fixed trigger; often used in skeet and sporting.

Naming patterns are not strictly sequential. Some numbers (e.g. MX14, MX16) correspond to specific gauges or limited runs rather than a linear progression.

#### 3.2.3 High Tech Series (HT / HTS)

- First introduced around **2015** as a modern evolution of MX8.[18]
- Key features:  
  - Wider receiver for increased central mass and altered balance.  
  - Designed to keep more weight between the hands, reducing muzzle flip and perceived recoil.[18][19]  
  - Highly customizable cosmetics: colored logos, engraved side panels, flag inlays, and special editions (e.g. HT 2020, HT 2024).[88]
- models include:  
  - **HT 12** – Standard 12-gauge sporting/trap O/U.  
  - **HT RS** – Trap builds with high or adjustable ribs.  
  - **HT 2020 / HT 2024** – Limited-edition configurations with unique finishes and sometimes revised ergonomics.  
  - **High Tech S (HTS)** – Fixed-trigger versions for those preferring non-removable triggers.[18][125]

#### 3.2.4 TM Series – Single-Barrel Trap Guns

- **TM1** – Classic single-barrel trap gun introduced for American trap in the late 1960s.  
- Subsequent TM models (TMX, TM9, TM9X) offer higher ribs, adjustable ribs, and refined barrel dynamics.[128][129]
- The TM series is iconic in ATA trap and has been widely used in the Grand American and other major events.
- **Grand America 1 & 2** – TM-based unsingle and top-single trap guns named after the Grand American tournament; optimized for handicap trap.[8]

#### 3.2.5 Other Notable Model Names

- **Mirage** – Historically, an MX8 variant marketed as the “Ithaca Perazzi Mirage” in some markets.[20]
- **Comp I (Competition I)** – Early O/U model name used before MX naming fully standardized.
- **MT6** – 1970s fixed-trigger O/U, associated with the 1976 Montreal Olympics, seen as a forerunner of MX12.[16]
- **MXS** – Modern fixed-trigger sporting model line, often positioned as a more accessible sporting clays gun.
- **Pigeon grade guns** – Configurations optimized for live-pigeon and helice shooting, usually heavier, tight-choked, and with no safety.

#### 3.2.6 Evolution Highlights

- The **MX8 action** remains the core architecture for over 50 years.  
- Innovations focus on:  
  - Adjustable ribs (3–5-position systems) for tunable POI.[29]  
  - Adjustable combs and buttplates.  
  - Alternate spring systems (leaf vs coil).  
  - Wider receivers (High Tech) for balance and recoil control.  
  - Cosmetic and ergonomic customization rather than wholesale mechanical redesign.
- Cross-compatibility: Many parts (e.g. triggers, barrels) are compatible across generations, though proper fitting is critical for safety.

#### 3.2.7 Platform Comparison Quick Answers

- Difference between **MX8** and **MX12**: MX8 uses a removable (drop-out) trigger group with leaf or coil spring options; MX12 is a fixed-trigger derivative that favors simplicity, durability, and a more traditional trigger feel.  
- Difference between **High Tech** and **MX8**: High Tech adds a wider, heavier receiver to shift balance between the hands and reduce muzzle flip; MX8 keeps the classic low-profile feel and lighter receiver mass.  
- Difference between **TM** and **MX O/U**: TM is a single-barrel trap platform optimized for singles/handicap; MX is an over/under platform that supports doubles and broader discipline coverage.  
- Difference between **DC** and **SHO**: DC is a side-by-side with coil mainsprings aimed at rugged serviceability; SHO is a sidelock platform built around traditional artistry and bespoke presentation.  
- Difference between **removable** and **fixed trigger**: Removable triggers prioritize fast service and swap capability; fixed triggers prioritize simplicity and continuity of fit while retaining the same core action geometry.

### 3.3 Technical Design and Manufacturing

#### 3.3.1 Action and Locking Mechanism

- **Locking system**: Low-profile, Boss-type design:[21][22]  
  - Monobloc with locking bites and side lugs.  
  - Dual locking bolts emerging from the receiver engage the monobloc bites.  
  - Broad hinge pins and hook surfaces distribute stress.  
- Design goals:  
  - Exceptional durability under very high round counts.  
  - Low bore axis relative to the hands to minimize muzzle flip.  
  - Weight concentrated under the bore line to drive recoil straight into the shoulder.  
- **High Tech variant**: Adds 3–4 ounces of receiver mass directly in line with the chambers, further reducing muzzle rise and smoothing handling.[18]

#### 3.3.2 Barrels

- Material: Proprietary high-grade **chromoly steel**; exact composition is closely guarded.[24]
- Manufacturing philosophy:  
  - Perazzi rejects **cold hammer forging** for top-tier barrels, arguing it can over-harden steel and induce stress.[25]  
  - Barrels are machined, honed, and hand-lapped to achieve desired elasticity and harmonics.
- Bores:  
  - Polished, non-chrome-lined bores; this is a deliberate choice for pattern consistency and feel rather than ease of cleaning.[26]  
  - Available bore diameters (12 gauge) typically range from **18.3–18.9 mm**, often customer-specified.[27]
- Lengths & profiles:  
  - Common lengths: approx. **29.5"**, **30.75"**, **31.5"** (metric equivalents 75, 78, 80 cm).[28]  
  - Barrel weights can be ordered heavier or lighter to tune swing and balance.[37][38]
- Ribs:  
  - Flat, semi-high, high, and extra-high ribs, including adjustable designs with three to five POI positions.[29][72]  
  - High-rib and adjustable-rib designs are common on trap and bunker guns (e.g. MX10, MX2000/3, HT RS).  
  - Sporting models typically use lower ribs for a 50/50 POI.  
  - Rib widths and profiles (e.g. 11x7, 11x11, 7x7) are selectable.[72]
- Chokes and side ribs:  
  - Fixed chokes are standard; constrictions can be specified per barrel (e.g. Skeet/Improved Cylinder, IM/Full).[70][71]  
  - Screw-in multi-chokes available as an option, with sets of tubes.  
  - Side ribs can be solid, ventilated, or deleted (skeet or lightweight configurations).[30][74]
- Regulation:  
  - Each O/U barrel set is soldered and regulated so both barrels shoot to the same POI.  
  - Regulation is verified on a pattern plate and in test tunnels at the factory.[43]

#### 3.3.3 Triggers and Lockwork

- **Detachable trigger groups (MX8-style)**:[32][33]  
  - Entire trigger-plate assembly removes from the bottom of the receiver via latch.  
  - Contains hammers, sears, springs, and safety/barrel selector (if present).  
  - Advantages: Quick serviceability, ability to carry a spare group, and compact receiver design.
- **Spring options**:  
  - **Leaf (flat) mainsprings** – extremely fast lock time and crisp feel; can eventually break from fatigue.[36]  
  - **Coil mainsprings** – slightly slower lock time but high durability and easier replacement.  
  - Many MX8 triggers can be ordered with either system; fixed-trigger guns (MX12, HTS) generally use coil mainsprings.[16][33]
- **Trigger characteristics**:  
  - Simple, robust design with relatively few parts.  
  - Emphasis on large working surfaces and minimal linkages for reliability.[32]  
  - Mechanical triggers (not inertia-dependent) are common in competition builds.  
  - Non-selective triggers (bottom barrel first) are typical for trap; selective triggers are standard or optional on skeet/sporting models.
- **Release triggers**:  
  - Not installed by the factory but often fitted by specialist gunsmiths for trap shooters.  
  - Factory stance: supported by design simplicity but not covered under warranty if modified.

#### 3.3.4 Springs and Service Intervals

- Perazzi uses a mix of **leaf and coil springs** depending on model and function:  
  - Main hammer springs: leaf or coil, customer-selectable on many MX8 triggers.[33]  
  - Ancillary functions (ejectors, top lever, sears): small coil springs.[36]
- Typical wear-and-service guidance:[35][36]  
  - Routine inspection recommended periodically for high-volume shooters.  
  - Major overhauls (springs, firing pins, etc.) often considered around **30,000–40,000 rounds** or as needed.  
  - There is **no mandated annual factory service**; the guns are designed for long intervals between major work.

#### 3.3.5 Balance and Handling

- Barrel weights, stock dimensions, and receiver mass are tuned to achieve a desired balance point.[37][38]  
- Customers can specify their preferred balance (e.g. slightly muzzle-heavy vs. neutral).  
- High Tech receivers place more mass between the hands for smoother, more "centered" swing characteristics.[18][39]
- Stocks may be hollowed or weighted to fine-tune balance; many are fitted with cast-off and palm swell for ergonomics.[40][41]

#### 3.3.6 Machining and Craftsmanship

- Factory in **Botticino, Italy** spans ~9,000 m² and uses modern **CNC machines** for high-precision fabrication of receivers, barrels, and internal parts.[40]
- Critical interfaces (barrel-to-action fit, stock inletting, trigger tuning) are hand-fitted by experienced craftsmen.[40][42]
- Every gun is test-fired, proofed, and checked for POI and pattern quality in an underground test tunnel before delivery.[43]
- Stock work:  
  - High-grade walnut, hand-shaped and checkered.  
  - Oil or lacquer finish; adjustable comb and other features available.[81][84][85]
- Overall philosophy: **Traditional gunsmithing + state-of-the-art technology** to deliver a repeatable yet bespoke product.[44]

### 3.6 Customization and Ordering Process

#### 3.6.1 General Philosophy

- Perazzi offers **full customization at production-gun prices**.  
- Most buyers either:  
  - Purchase a gun from existing dealer inventory, or  
  - Place a bespoke order specifying virtually every parameter.[67]
- Lead times typically about **6 months** (longer for complex engraving or multiple barrel sets).[40][68][69]

#### 3.6.2 Configuration Steps (High-Level)

If you are asking how to order a bespoke Perazzi or how to choose options, this is the typical configuration flow used by dealers and the factory.

1. **Choose platform and discipline**
   - Decide between MX, HT, TM, DC, or SHO.  
   - Choose intended use: trap, skeet, sporting clays, live pigeon, game, etc.[16]

2. **Select gauge and frame**
   - Common: 12 gauge.  
   - Optional: 20, 28, .410 – either on a **scaled frame** or as sub-gauge barrels for a 12-gauge frame.[27][31]

3. **Specify barrels**[27][28][70][71][72]
   - Length (28", 29.5", 30.75", 31.5", 32", 33", 34").

#### 3.7.3 Service and Maintenance Practices

If your top lever is nearing center, you need maintenance intervals, or you are unsure about routine care, start with the guidance below.

- Basic guidance:[35][110]  
  - Keep action surfaces clean and lightly lubricated (oil on pivots, grease on locking surfaces).  
  - Clean barrels regularly; avoid corrosion and moisture.  
  - Use snap caps if dry-firing to protect firing pins.  
  - Do not store with top lever or springs excessively tensioned; relax tension where practical (e.g. leaving removable triggers in fired state during long-term storage).

- Service intervals:  
  - Routine inspection annually or as usage dictates.  
  - Major overhaul (springs, pins, locking bolt) only after high round counts (often 30,000–100,000+ shells), depending on wear.[35][36][112]

- Service network:  
  - **Perazzi USA** gunsmiths in Azusa.  
  - Factory-trained specialists (e.g. Giacomo Sporting, Whiz White in the U.S.).[111]  
  - Factory refurbishment options: rebluing, wood refinishing, checkering recut, and general mechanical refresh.

#### 3.7.4 Warranty

- Standard warranty: typically **two years** for the original owner on new guns.[113]
- Scope: manufacturing defects in materials or workmanship.  
- Exclusions: normal wear parts (springs, firing pins) and issues arising from third-party modifications.

### 3.8 Pricing Structure and Value

#### 3.8.1 General Positioning

- Perazzi occupies the **upper tier** of the shotgun market.  
- Pricing reflects craftsmanship, customization, and competition pedigree, but is generally below ultra-boutique makers (e.g. Fabbri, high-end British “best guns”).[138]

#### 3.8.2 Pricing Structure (Non-Numeric Overview)

If you are asking about Perazzi price ranges, note that numeric pricing is intentionally omitted here; this section focuses on the non-numeric structure and cost drivers.

- Base pricing is driven primarily by platform, grade, and configuration complexity.  
- Core competition platforms (MX and High Tech) sit in the premium tier; sidelock and high-grade engraving move builds into the highest tiers.  
- Single-barrel trap guns (TM) vary by rib and configuration; combo sets add substantial cost due to extra barrels and fitting.  
- Special editions and bespoke options can move a build into higher tiers based on wood, engraving, and finish choices.

For current pricing or quotes, work through an authorized Perazzi dealer.

#### 3.8.3 Upgrades and Cost Drivers

- **Wood grade**:[81]
  - Higher figure and rarer blanks increase cost.  
  - SC2, SC3, and SCO represent progressively higher grades.  

- **Engraving**:[117][118][131][134][135]
  - Engraving complexity and hours are among the largest cost drivers.  
  - Full-coverage and gold-inlay work place builds at the top tier.  

- **Barrels & sub-gauges**:[31]  
  - Extra barrel sets and sub-gauge configurations increase cost.  
  - Scaled-frame small gauges carry a premium due to dedicated actions.  

- **Other options**:[132][133]  
  - Multi-choke systems, special ribs, glove grips, adjustable buttplates, and barrel porting may add additional cost.

#### 3.8.4 Value and Resale

- A base competition-grade Perazzi performs identically, in functional terms, to a heavily engraved high-grade Perazzi; upgrades primarily affect aesthetics and personal expression.[138]
- Used Perazzis retain strong **resale value**, especially popular configurations and small-gauge models.  
- Limited editions and high-grade engraving can appreciate, but most buyers view Perazzi primarily as a **long-term use tool** that can be rebuilt indefinitely.

- Key characteristics (conceptual):  
  - Highly curated field; participation based on merit and alignment with brand ethos.  
  - Minimal competing logos; the event itself becomes a brand statement.  
  - Integrated with TCN storytelling and long-form coverage.

*(Note: As of the referenced documents, the Perazzi Invitational is a strategic concept and narrative device; operational details may evolve.)*

#### 3.9.2 American Trap – Grand American & ATA

- Historically strong presence at the **Grand American** and ATA major events.  
- **Perazzi Classic** (1998–2005): special handicap event at the Grand American, often awarding a new Perazzi shotgun as the top prize.[142]
- Perazzi continues to sponsor specific events (e.g. President’s Handicap) and maintain a high-profile vendor presence.[143]
- Daniele Perazzi was inducted into the **Trapshooting Hall of Fame** in 2019 for his contributions to ATA trap.[144][11]

#### 3.9.3 International Competitions and FITASC

- Widely used in ISSF World Cups, World Championships, and Continental championships.  
- Popular in FITASC Sporting and Compak; numerous world champions (e.g. George Digweed) attribute part of their success to Perazzi guns.[52]

#### 3.9.4 Factory Visits and Owner Community

- Factory showroom functions as a **mini-museum** with extensive displays of models and engraving examples.[146][147]
- Customers often describe visits as a key emotional milestone in their Perazzi journey.  
- Perazzi hosts or supports gatherings at major shoots, reinforcing a sense of **family and community** among owners.
- Online owner communities (forums, social media groups) actively discuss fitting, maintenance, and configuration choices.

#### 3.9.5 Sponsored Shooters and Ambassadors

### 3.10 Counterfeits, Grey Market, and Service Integrity (authenticity, safety)

#### 3.10.1 Authentic Parts and Aftermarket Risk

If you are worried about counterfeit (fake) parts or non-factory replacements, this section summarizes the official guidance.

- Perazzi warns against **counterfeit or non-genuine (aftermarket) parts**, especially springs and firing pins.[148]  
- Third-party (aftermarket) parts may be cheaper but can cause:  
  - Inconsistent trigger feel.  
  - Premature breakage.  
  - Safety issues.  
- Use of non-genuine parts can **void warranty** if failures are linked to such components.

#### 3.10.2 Grey-Market Guns and Import Channels

- **Perazzi USA** is the sole official importer for the U.S.; other countries have analogous official agents.[149]
- Grey-market (gray-market, parallel import) guns are those moved outside official channels.
- Guns imported or assembled outside official channels may:  
  - Lack warranty and factory support.  
  - Have unknown histories or questionable parts.  
- Very low prices on “new” Perazzis from unofficial sources are a red flag for grey-market or stolen guns.

#### 3.10.3 Mixing Components and “Parts Guns”

- Because Perazzi actions and barrels share similar geometry, some gunsmiths or owners assemble **“parts guns”** from mismatched receivers, barrels, and forends.  
- Risks of mismatching serialized components without factory fitting:[21]  
  - Incorrect headspace.  
  - Improper locking-bolt engagement.  
  - Ejector timing issues.  
  - Potential safety hazards.
- Factory policy: barrels, receivers, and forends with different serials should only be paired when properly fitted and verified by the factory or authorized experts.  
- Using mismatched components may void manufacturer responsibility.

#### 3.10.4 Trigger Group Interchangeability

- Any Perazzi drop-out trigger group will **physically fit** into any compatible receiver, but:[32]  
  - Triggers “wear in” with their original receivers; swapping can accelerate wear.  
  - Trigger pull characteristics may change in a different receiver.  
  - Minor generational differences can affect safety and reliability.
- Perazzi’s stance:  
  - Swapping triggers for an **emergency backup** in competition is fine.  
  - Regular use should rely on a trigger tuned to that specific receiver.

#### 3.10.5 Aftermarket Modifications and Factory Service

- Common third-party modifications: barrel porting, forcing-cone lengthening, aftermarket adjustable combs, recoil reducers, and release-trigger conversions.  
- Factory disclaimers:  
  - Such modifications are at the owner’s risk.  
  - Perazzi may decline warranty or certain services on heavily modified barrels or actions.  
  - If necessary, the factory may charge to replace non-factory parts back to original spec.

#### 3.10.6 Serial Number Integrity and Authentication

- Every Perazzi receiver and barrel set is **serialized and proofed**.  
- Italian proof-house markings (Gardone) and serials can be used to authenticate guns.  
- Perazzi and Perazzi USA can often confirm import history and configuration by serial number.  
- Buyers are encouraged to verify serial authenticity, especially for used or unusually cheap guns.

## 4. Edge Cases, Exceptions, and Caveats

- **Non-factory barrels on existing receivers**  
  - Always require expert fitting and POI verification.  
  - Unsafe combinations can appear to lock correctly but have poor headspace or regulation.

- **Release triggers**  
  - Widely used in trap but not installed by Perazzi at the factory.  
  - Quality and safety depend on the gunsmith’s expertise; issues may not be covered under warranty.

- **Extremely high round-count guns**  
  - Locking bolts, hinge pins, and monobloc surfaces can wear over 100k+ shells.  
  - Oversized locking bolts and other parts are designed for refurbishment.  

- **Owner-applied modifications**  
  - Cosmetic or ergonomic changes (pads, comb hardware, etc.) usually benign if properly installed.  
  - Structural changes (porting, cone changes, re-chambering) should be entrusted only to experts familiar with Perazzi tolerances.

- **Ambiguities in model naming**  
  - Some historical model names (Comp I, Mirage, MT6) have overlapping or region-specific usage.  
  - When in doubt, resolve by **platform (MX/TM/HT)** and mechanical configuration rather than name alone.
