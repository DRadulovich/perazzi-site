## 1. Overview

This guide reframes three common concerns (price, lead times, and limited advertising) as intentional value signals. It is written as public-facing messaging for prospects, owners, and anyone asking why Perazzi operates differently than mass-market brands.

## 2. Core Reframes

### 2.1 High Price (pricing policy / cost)

- Reframe: Price is a symbol of elite status, exclusivity, and craftsmanship rather than a simple cost.
- Why it works: Limited output and bespoke decisions signal rarity, care, and long-term value.
- Public-facing phrasing: "The price reflects the time, attention, and legacy built into every Perazzi."

### 2.2 Lengthy Lead Times (wait time / delivery timing)

- Reframe: Lead time is proof of meticulous, hand-guided artistry rather than delay.
- Why it works: The wait highlights that each gun is built with deliberate, human precision.
- Public-facing phrasing: "Waiting is part of the craft; a Perazzi is made for you, not pulled from a shelf."

### 2.3 Limited Traditional Advertising (low-visibility marketing / minimal ads)

- Reframe: Quiet marketing signals confidence, authenticity, and a brand that does not chase attention.
- Why it works: The story is carried through lived experiences, not constant promotion.
- Public-facing phrasing: "Perazzi does not need to shout. Its legacy speaks for itself."

## 3. Messaging Principles

- Keep language centered on craftsmanship, legacy, and identity rather than transactional sales claims.
- Avoid quoting exact prices or framing cost as a discount opportunity.
- Avoid promising fixed delivery dates; emphasize care, time, and precision instead.
- Position limited advertising as intentional focus on authenticity and meaningful experiences.

## 4. Common Questions

#### Why is a Perazzi so expensive?

Perazzi pricing reflects the level of craftsmanship, bespoke attention, and long-term value that goes into every build. The price is not a premium for branding alone; it is the cost of rarity, care, and legacy.

#### Why are Perazzi lead times so long?

Lead times exist because each Perazzi is built with deliberate precision rather than mass production. The wait time is part of the process that ensures fit, balance, and lasting performance.

#### Why doesn't Perazzi advertise more?

Perazzi chooses quiet, story-driven marketing over constant advertising. The brand relies on lived experiences, community, and performance to speak louder than traditional ads.

#### Is the wait time worth it?

The wait is worth it when you value a gun that is tuned, finished, and balanced to last for decades. It signals that your Perazzi is crafted for longevity, not quick turnover.

#### Is limited advertising a red flag?

For Perazzi, limited advertising is a signal of confidence and focus. It reflects a brand that invests in craftsmanship and legacy rather than visibility for its own sake.
