# Consumer Warning Notice

Perazzi takes great pride in crafting premium, high-performance shotguns, each meticulously designed and assembled to the highest standards of quality, precision, and authenticity. To preserve the warranty, the integrity and value of your Perazzi shotgun, please be aware of the following potential risks:

## Aftermarket Engraving on Receivers

Modifications to the receiver, such as unauthorized engraving or case color hardening, may not meet Perazzi's craftsmanship standards and could compromise structural integrity, are considered counterfeit or fake and will diminish the firearm's value. Ensure any engraving is performed by a Perazzi-authorized artisan to maintain authenticity and warranty coverage.

## False Sideplates

Some firearms may be altered with non-original sideplates to mimic higher-grade models. These additions may not meet Perazzi’s quality standards, be potentially dangerous and can misrepresent the shotgun’s authenticity and value. Always confirm authenticity through Perazzi’s official verification process. As stated above, guns with aftermarket sideplates are counterfeits.

## Mixed and Matched Components

The mixing and matching of components from different Perazzi models or assemblies may result in improper fitting, reduced performance, or mechanical issues. Only Perazzi factory-fitted components ensure optimal function, safety, and resale value. Beware of altered serial numbers on barrels, forends and especially when illegally changed on the action.

## Aftermarket Barrel Work

Modifications such as re-choking, porting, re-sleeving, back-boring, or barrel alterations performed by unauthorized third parties can affect the shotgun’s balance, performance, and safety. Such modifications will void the warranty and reduce the gun’s value.

## Aftermarket Parts

Aftermarket parts are not produced to the same precision, tolerances, hardness and metallurgy as factory produced parts. Use of aftermarket parts could compromise performance, functionality, reliability and accelerate wear. Perazzi USA and authorized gunsmiths have the right to refuse any service on guns with these parts. Beware of gunsmiths that do not disclose the use of these parts.

## Protect Your Investment

To ensure you are purchasing a genuine and unaltered Perazzi shotgun:

- Purchase only from authorized Perazzi dealers or trusted sources.  
- Request and review the firearm's original documentation, including serial numbers and proof of origin.  
- Avoid unauthorized modifications and consult Perazzi for any custom work or repairs.

Perazzi is committed to the quality and satisfaction of our customers. If you have concerns or need to verify the authenticity of your shotgun, contact our official customer service team.
