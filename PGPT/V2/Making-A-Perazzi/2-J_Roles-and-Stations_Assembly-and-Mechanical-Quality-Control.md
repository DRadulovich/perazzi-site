## 1. High-Level Overview

This document describes the **Assembly & Mechanical Quality Control (QC) station** in the Perazzi factory.

At this station, all **finished components** of the shotgun are:

- Brought together into the **fully assembled firearm**.
- **Function-tested** and tuned so that all mechanisms work together smoothly.
- Checked to ensure the gun meets **mechanical, safety, and feel** criteria before pattern testing and delivery.

This station:

- Confirms that work from **all upstream stations** (design, machining, barrel fabrication, trigger assembly, stocking, finishing) integrates correctly.
- Performs detailed **mechanical QC** on:
  - Lock-up and headspace.
  - Triggers, safety, and barrel selector.
  - Ejectors and extraction.
  - Firing pin protrusion and strike quality.
  - Balance, weight, and general “Perazzi feel”.
- Sends any issues back to the relevant station for correction as needed.

The output is a **mechanically flawless, fully assembled shotgun** that is ready for pattern testing, final fitting, and delivery.

## 2. Key Concepts & Glossary

### 2.1 Roles and Station

- **Assembly & Mechanical QC Station (canonical)**  
  - Synonyms: *Final Assembly Bench*, *Mechanical QC Bench*, *Assembly & Test*.  
  - Definition: Station where all major components are assembled into the complete shotgun, and where mechanical testing and tuning are performed.

- **Assembler / Mechanical QC Specialist (canonical)**  
  - Synonyms: *Final Assembler*, *Assembly Gunsmith*, *Mechanical Inspector*.  
  - Definition: Craftsperson responsible for final assembly, mechanical tuning, and systematic QC checks before the gun is passed to patterning and final fitting.

### 2.2 Mechanism Concepts

- **Lock-Up**  
  - Engagement of **locking bolt** with barrel **bites** and monobloc.  
  - Determines whether the gun closes solidly, with no play (“on the face”).

- **Top Lever Position**  
  - At rest, a new gun’s top lever typically sits **right of center** (e.g., around “4 o’clock”) to allow for future wear; centered lever on a new gun can indicate insufficient engagement.

- **Headspace**  
  - Distance between the chambered cartridge base and breech face; checked with **go / no-go gauges**.

- **Cocking & Opening Effort**  
  - Effort required to open the gun and cock hammers; must be smooth and not excessive.

- **Ejector & Extractor Function**  
  - **Ejectors**: throw fired hulls clear of the chambers.  
  - **Extractors**: raise shells for manual removal.  
  - Timing and strength are critical: fired shells should eject smartly, unfired shells should extract only.

### 2.3 Trigger & Safety Concepts

- **Single Trigger with Selector**  
  - One trigger that fires both barrels sequentially; selector chooses which barrel fires first.

- **Inertia Trigger**  
  - Uses recoil from first shot to reset/arm second sear.  
  - Needs sufficient recoil to function reliably.

- **Mechanical Trigger**  
  - Second sear reset mechanically without relying on recoil; more tolerant of very light loads.

- **Doubling**  
  - Undesired discharge of both barrels at once when only one is intended to fire; must be eliminated in QC.

- **Safety**  
  - Manual mechanism that blocks trigger or sear motion.  
  - Some guns may have optional **auto-safety** (engages when gun is opened) depending on model/usage.

### 2.4 Quality & Specification Concepts

- **Trigger Pull Weight**  
  - Force required to release each sear; measured with a trigger pull gauge.  
  - Target values may be set by internal spec or customer request (e.g., ~3.5–4 lb).

- **Firing Pin Protrusion**  
  - Extent to which pins project through breech face when fired; must be sufficient to ignite primers but not excessive.

- **“Perazzi Feel”**  
  - Informal description of the overall tactile qualities of a finished gun:  
    - Smooth opening and closing with controlled resistance.  
    - Solid, authoritative lock-up click.  
    - Crisp, consistent trigger breaks.  
    - Balanced weight and swing.

- **Balance & Total Weight**  
  - Overall gun weight and center of gravity; may need to match specific target values, especially in bespoke orders.

- **Screw Timing**  
  - Aligning screw slots in a consistent orientation (where practiced), often as a mark of meticulous assembly.

### 2.5 Test & Simulation Concepts

- **Snap Caps / Dummy Shells**  
  - Inert cartridges used to test firing, extraction, and ejection without live ammunition.

- **Recoil Simulation**  
  - Using a **mallet tap** or firm strike on the butt, or a sharp wrist motion, to simulate recoil and test inertia trigger reset.

- **Pattern Testing (Reference to Next Stage)**  
  - Live firing at pattern boards or targets to verify regulation and POI; typically occurs after mechanical QC, but mechanical QC may coordinate or perform initial functional shots.

## 3. Main Content

### 3.1 Station Purpose & Success Criteria

#### 3.1.1 Purpose

The **Assembly & Mechanical QC station** is responsible for:

- Assembling **all finished components** into a complete shotgun:
  - Receiver/action with internal lockwork and trigger group.
  - Barrel set with ejectors installed and regulated.
  - Finished stock and fore-end with their iron/metal parts attached.
- Performing thorough **mechanical and functional tests** to:
  - Verify that every mechanism behaves as intended.
  - Fine-tune the feel of the gun (opening, closing, trigger, ejectors, safety, etc.).
- Catching and correcting any issues before:
  - Pattern testing and POI confirmation.
  - Final fitting with the shooter (for bespoke guns).
  - Delivery to customer.

It is the **final internal gate** for mechanical integrity.

#### 3.1.2 Success Criteria

A shotgun passes this station successfully if:

- **Basic Mechanical Functions**  
  - Opens and closes smoothly, without excessive stiffness or looseness.  
  - Locks up firmly with no play at the breech (“on the face”).  
  - Top lever returns to a consistent rest position right of center, indicating healthy engagement margin.

- **Trigger & Safety**  
  - Triggers break cleanly at target pull weights (within specified tolerance).  
  - No **doubling** occurs; each trigger pull releases only the intended hammer.  
  - Second shot (inertia or mechanical) consistently functions under realistic conditions.  
  - Manual safety positively blocks trigger/sears when engaged; auto-safety (if used) operates as specified.  
  - Barrel selector reliably determines which barrel fires first.

- **Ejectors & Extraction**  
  - Fired shells eject smartly and evenly from both barrels.  
  - Unfired shells are extracted but not ejected.  
  - Ejectors are properly timed and equal in strength.

- **Firing Pin & Headspace**  
  - Headspace is within specification:  
    - Action closes on **go** gauge.  
    - Action does **not** close on **no-go** gauge.  
  - Firing pins strike primers centrally and with adequate force.  
  - Pins rebound or retract properly; no risk of pin protrusion interfering with loading.

- **Balance & Feel**  
  - Overall weight and balance match internal spec or customer order (if specified).  
  - Gun mounts, points, and swings in a way consistent with its intended discipline.

- **Cosmetic & Structural Integrity**  
  - No new scratches, dings, or finish damage introduced in assembly.  
  - Wood-to-metal joints remain tight, with no new gaps or cracks (especially around stock head).  
  - All screws are properly tightened (and, where practiced, neatly timed).

- **Documentation & Traceability**  
  - QC checklist (explicit or implicit) is fully satisfied.  
  - Any adjustments or deviations from baseline spec are recorded for future reference.

### 3.3 Core Knowledge & Skills

Assemblers at this station require broad, integrated understanding of the gun.

#### 3.3.1 Comprehensive Mechanism Knowledge

- Understand how all subsystems interact:  
  - Locking bolt engagement with barrel bites and monobloc.  
  - Cocking system: how opening the gun cocks hammers or strikers.  
  - Ejector system: how ejector sears are set when shots are fired and tripped on opening.  
  - Trigger system (inertia or mechanical) and safety/selector linkage.  
- Interpret symptoms:  
  - Stiff opening may indicate issues with cocking cams or ejector springs.  
  - Top lever behavior may reflect lock-up geometry.

#### 3.3.2 Precision Instrument Use

- **Headspace Gauges**  
  - Confirm that gun closes correctly on go gauge and not on no-go gauge.

- **Trigger Pull Gauge**  
  - Measure and verify pull weights for each barrel; compare with spec or customer request.

- **Alignment & Strike Checks**  
  - Use primed cases or specialized snap caps to examine firing pin strike **position and depth**.

- **Visual & Alignment Tools**  
  - Use lights, mirrors, and eye judgment to confirm that barrels align correctly on the action (coarse boresighting, with fine POI confirmed later in pattern testing).

#### 3.3.3 Fine Adjustment & Micro-Fitting

- **Lock-Up & Top Lever**  
  - Evaluate initial tightness:  
    - Lever far right and difficult to close → may require minimal polishing or lock-bolt adjustment.  
    - Lever near center on new gun → may require fitting slightly oversize locking bolt or adjusting bites to ensure long-term tightness.

- **Cocking Effort**  
  - Detect excessive resistance when opening; trace to cocking rods, cams, or springs; polish or adjust as needed.

- **Ejector Timing & Strength**  
  - Ensure both ejectors trip at appropriate time and with balanced force.  
  - Adjust by very small sear surface changes or spring selection.

- **Trigger Tuning**  
  - Confirm crispness and pull weights; minor adjustments (via sear geometry or springs) when within safe design limits.  
  - Ensure second-shot function (especially inertia triggers) under realistic simulated recoil.

- **Fore-end & Latch Fitting**  
  - Adjust latch engagement to achieve a **positive but not excessive** snap-on and secure fit with no wobble.

#### 3.3.4 Safety & Selector Verification

- Confirm that safety effectively blocks firing when engaged:  
  - With safety on, triggers should not release hammers.  
- Verify selector operation (if present):  
  - Selected barrel must fire first; second shot must follow correctly.  
- Confirm configuration (auto-safety vs manual-only) per model and order.

#### 3.3.5 Firing Pin & Hammer Performance

- Evaluate firing pin protrusion and rebound; ensure no dragging or sticking.  
- Check that hammer/striker springs provide sufficient energy without excessive cocking effort.  
- Understand and correct potential misalignment or weak strikes.

#### 3.3.6 Smoothness, Sound, and “Feel”

- Develop a **calibrated sense of feel**:  
  - Opening: smooth camming, no grinding or sticking.  
  - Lock-up: authoritative but not harsh click.  
  - Cocking: consistent resistance throughout motion.  
- Recognize “wrong” sounds (scraping, rattles, asymmetrical ejector noises) as indicators of problems to investigate.

#### 3.3.7 Stock Bolt Torque & Wood Protection

- Tighten stock bolt enough to ensure secure contact between stock head and action, but not so much as to crush fibers or induce cracks.  
- Understand how over-tightening can cause long-term stock head failures and how under-tightening leads to movement and looseness.

#### 3.3.8 Systematic Test Procedures

- Follow a **repeatable checklist** covering:  
  - Lock-up and lever position.  
  - Trigger and safety function (including selector).  
  - Firing pin strike and rebound.  
  - Ejector and extraction tests (both barrels, individually and together).  
  - Basic balance and weight check.  
- Maintain discipline: every gun passes the same sequence, minimizing risk of missed checks.

#### 3.3.9 Proof, Regulation, and Marking Awareness

- Confirm presence and correctness of **proof marks** and required legal markings.  
- Understand that barrels and actions are proofed earlier, but verify that post-proof work has not altered safety-critical elements.  
- Coordinate with pattern testers if mechanical behavior raises questions about regulation or POI that might be design-related.

---

### 3.4 Decisions & Trade-Offs

#### 3.4.1 Tightness vs User-Friendliness

- **Tighter Lock-Up / Stiffer Opening**  
  - Pros: longer service life before looseness; perception of robustness.  
  - Cons: can be fatiguing, especially for shooters opening the gun thousands of times (e.g., trap shooters).

- **Easier Opening / Softer Lock-Up**  
  - Pros: more comfortable for frequent use; easier to operate for shooters with less hand strength.  
  - Cons: reduced wear margin if too loose; earlier need for tightening or service.

**Practical approach:**  
- Target a **slightly stiff but smooth** feel at delivery:  
  - Top lever comfortably right-of-center.  
  - Action firm but not resistant in an abrupt or gritty way.

#### 3.4.2 Ejectors vs Extractors

- **Ejector Configuration**  
  - Pros: fast unloading, ideal for competition.  
  - Cons: shells fly away; less suitable for some hunters who prefer to retain shells.

- **Extractor-Only Configuration**  
  - Pros: more controlled shell removal; preferred by some game shooters.  
  - Cons: slower operation for high-volume shooting.

**Practical approach:**  
- Configure according to **model and customer order**:  
  - Competition models typically fully eject.  
  - Some builds may have ejector sears disabled or omitted for extractor-only behavior.

#### 3.4.3 Lubrication Amount & Type

- **More Lubricant**  
  - Pros: better protection during initial wear-in; reduces galling on high-pressure surfaces.  
  - Cons: attracts dirt and powder residue; can migrate into wood.

- **Minimal Lubricant**  
  - Pros: cleaner gun, less risk of oil soaking into wood.  
  - Cons: higher risk of early wear or galling if too dry.

**Practical approach:**  
- Use quality grease on **hinge pins, locking lugs, and cocking cams**.  
- Use light oil in **lockwork and triggers**.  
- Wipe off excess, leaving a controlled, thin film.

#### 3.4.4 Cosmetic Perfection vs Risk of Overworking

- **Chasing Minor Imperfections**  
  - Pros: can yield near-perfect aesthetics (e.g., wood-metal flushness).  
  - Cons: risk of damaging finish or wood when trying to correct negligible issues at final stage.

**Practical approach:**  
- Correct issues that are **visible and meaningful** to function or aesthetics.  
- Avoid risky interventions for tiny deviations that would require major refinish work for marginal gain.

#### 3.4.5 Live-Fire Testing Timing

- **Test-Fire During Assembly/QC**  
  - Pros: immediate verification of ignition, doubling, and basic behavior under recoil.  
  - Cons: more logistics (containment, noise, cleanup).

- **Rely Mostly on Pattern/Proof Stage**  
  - Pros: centralizes live-fire testing.  
  - Cons: issues discovered slightly later; still requires assembly/QC to simulate mechanical behavior thoroughly beforehand.

**Practical approach (conceptual):**  
- Use **snap caps and mechanical simulations** extensively at assembly bench.  
- Ensure that any doubtful behavior is resolved before or during pattern testing, with quick feedback loops between assembly and patterning areas.

#### 3.4.6 Customer-Specific vs Default Setup

- **Default Spec**  
  - Standard trigger weights, ejector behavior, and lubrication; used when no custom instructions exist.

- **Customer-Specific Tuning**  
  - Custom trigger weights, extractor-only preference, specific balance targets, or safety configuration.

**Practical approach:**  
- Follow documented customer orders and **Perazzi Experience** fitting data where provided.  
- Otherwise, assemble to **well-defined Perazzi defaults** for the model.

- **Collimator / Optical Aids (Conceptual)**  
  - For coarse checking of barrel alignment relative to rib; final POI verification occurs at pattern testing.

---

### 3.6 Failure Modes & Diagnosis

#### 3.6.1 Doubling (Both Barrels Fire at Once)

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Both firing pins show fresh strikes after a single trigger pull.  
- **Likely Causes:**  
  - Too light sear engagement or incorrect sear geometry.  
  - Inertia block issues (inertia trigger) that fail to isolate the second sear properly.  
- **Diagnosis & Correction:**  
  - Use snap caps and simulate recoil, watching for simultaneous drops.  
  - Increase sear engagement or adjust spring forces; correct inertia block behavior.  
  - Retest until doubling is eliminated.

#### 3.6.2 Failure to Fire Second Barrel

- **Symptoms:**  
  - First barrel fires; second does not, or trigger dead for second shot.  
- **Likely Causes:**  
  - Inertia trigger: insufficient recoil to move inertia block (e.g., very light loads or too stiff inertia spring).  
  - Mechanical trigger: mis-timed selector or linkage.  
- **Diagnosis & Correction:**  
  - Simulate recoil with mallet or sharp motion; test with different loads.  
  - Adjust inertia block mass/spring tension or mechanical linkage until second shot is reliable under realistic conditions.

#### 3.6.3 Weak Primer Strikes

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Shallow primer dent; occasional misfires.  
- **Likely Causes:**  
  - Weak hammer/striker springs.  
  - Short or misaligned firing pins.  
  - Excessive drag (dirt, thick grease) in hammer/pin channels.  
- **Diagnosis & Correction:**  
  - Compare strike marks with standard; measure protrusion if needed.  
  - Replace or adjust springs; clean and lightly lubricate channels; correct pin alignment.

#### 3.6.4 Hard Opening or Closing

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Excessive resistance when opening or closing; grinding feel.  
- **Likely Causes:**  
  - Over-tight lock-up, burrs on bites or locking surfaces.  
  - Cocking cams or rods binding.  
  - Ejector springs or sears causing excess friction.  
- **Diagnosis & Correction:**  
  - Inspect with marking compounds (e.g., contact blue) to reveal high spots.  
  - Lightly stone or polish offending surfaces; adjust springs as needed.  
  - Aim for firm but smooth motion.

#### 3.6.5 Loose on Face (Play at Breech)

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Detectable movement between barrels and action when closed.  
- **Likely Causes:**  
  - Insufficient locking bolt engagement; improper bite geometry.  
- **Diagnosis & Correction:**  
  - Check lock-up contact pattern; verify top lever position.  
  - Fit slightly oversize locking bolt or adjust bite surfaces.  
  - Ensure new guns leave with zero perceptible play.

#### 3.6.6 Safety Malfunction

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Gun fires with safety engaged; safety too loose or too tight.  
- **Likely Causes:**  
  - Misfitted or misassembled safety bar; weak detent; mechanical interference.  
- **Diagnosis & Correction:**  
  - Test repeatedly with safety on; inspect safety linkage.  
  - Correct bar alignment, adjust detent and travel; verify safety cannot be bypassed by normal trigger pull.

#### 3.6.7 Ejector Issues

- **Symptoms:**  
  - One ejector weak, inconsistent, or non-functional.  
  - Both ejectors firing when only one barrel is fired, or vice versa.  
- **Likely Causes:**  
  - Unequal spring tensions; dirty or rough ejector channels.  
  - Incorrect ejector sear engagement or trip timing.  
- **Diagnosis & Correction:**  
  - Test each barrel independently with snap caps.  
  - Clean and polish channels; adjust springs or sear surfaces; verify equal strength and correct timing.

#### 3.6.8 Fore-end Latch Problems

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Fore-end difficult to latch or remove; or loose and rattling.  
- **Likely Causes:**  
  - Over-tight or under-tight latch engagement; misfitted fore-end iron.  
- **Diagnosis & Correction:**  
  - Evaluate closing force and fit; check for gaps or movement.  
  - Slightly adjust internal metal surfaces (stoning, peening) for proper fit.

#### 3.6.9 Cracks During Assembly

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Audible crack sound; visible line in stock head or wrist when tightening stock.  
- **Likely Causes:**  
  - Hidden defect in wood; over-tightened stock bolt; stress concentration from inletting.  
- **Diagnosis & Correction:**  
  - Inspect for crack extent; assess structural risk.  
  - For minor internal cracks, high-quality repair (glue and possibly hidden reinforcement).  
  - For significant structural cracks, likely re-stock with a new blank.

#### 3.6.10 Cosmetic Scuffs & Handling Damage

- **Symptoms:**  
  - New scratches on metal or wood; marred screw slots.  
- **Diagnosis & Correction:**  
  - Visual inspection under strong light.  
  - Lightly re-polish and re-blue tiny marks (e.g., screw head), or perform spot wood repairs where possible.  
  - Replace visibly damaged parts if necessary.

#### 3.6.11 Balance & Weight Deviations

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Final gun weight differs from target; balance feels too front- or rear-heavy.  
- **Diagnosis & Correction:**  
  - Weigh gun and compare with spec.  
  - If needed and within safe bounds, add or remove small weights (e.g., inside stock bolt channel) or adjust non-critical internal material.  
  - Large deviations may indicate earlier-stage issues and prompt review.

### 3.7 What Mastery Looks Like

Mastery at the Assembly & Mechanical QC station is evident in **how the gun feels and behaves**, not just in what gauges say.

#### 3.7.1 Conductor of the “Symphony of Parts”

- The master assembler understands that every upstream station has contributed to a complex mechanism.  
- They bring parts together as a **cohesive instrument**, tuning interactions rather than treating components in isolation.

#### 3.7.2 Deep Sensory Calibration

- They can tell, by feel and sound alone, if:  
  - The top lever engages with proper tension.  
  - Cocking cams run smoothly when opening.  
  - Ejectors operate in unison and with matching force.  
  - Triggers break and reset as they should.

- They often perform eyes-closed tests: mounting, opening, and dry-firing to focus purely on tactile and auditory feedback.

#### 3.7.3 Efficiency with Thoroughness

- Experienced assemblers can build a gun quickly, but they **do not rush QC**.  
- They maintain a mental or written “multi-point check” (e.g., a “12-point” routine) repeated identically for every gun.  
- They prefer to **over-test** rather than risk a missed fault.

#### 3.7.4 Collaboration with Pattern Testers & Fitters

- They work closely with pattern-testing and fitting staff:  
  - If patterning reveals unexpected behavior (e.g., unusual recoil sensation or irregular POI that hints at mechanical influence), they investigate mechanical causes.  
  - They support final fitting sessions (e.g., Perazzi Experience) by making small mechanical tweaks as needed.

#### 3.7.5 Micro-Level Attention

- They notice and correct details others might overlook:  
  - A tiny burr on the trigger blade that could irritate the finger over long shooting sessions.  
  - Slight mismatch in ejector strength that, while functional, does not feel “right.”  
  - Screw head orientation or minor alignment improvements that signal care.

#### 3.7.6 Example Vignette: Luigi’s Twelve-Point Check (Composite, Illustrative)

> After assembling a custom Perazzi, Luigi, a senior assembler, begins his well-practiced twelve-point check.  
> He closes the gun and watches the top lever settle just right of center. He opens it, feeling the hammers cock with a smooth, even resistance. With snap caps in place, he pulls the trigger—one sharp click. He opens the gun and hears both ejectors ping in perfect unison as the snap caps leap clear.  
>  
> He repeats the test with the barrel selector reversed: same crisp break, same clean ejection. Next, he simulates recoil with a firm tap on the butt, testing the inertia system. Satisfied, he measures trigger weights, checks headspace with gauges, and inspects every screw slot under bright light.  
> Only when every item on his list is met—and the gun feels, in his hands, like a true Perazzi—does he sign off and send it on to pattern testing.

#### 3.7.7 Long-Term Reliability Mindset

- Masters understand that their work determines **how the gun behaves over years**:  
  - A slightly loose stock bolt may feel fine today but become a problem later.  
  - A marginal sear engagement might pass once but lead to doubling after wear.  
- They therefore bias decisions toward **robust margins** while preserving the refined feel expected of a Perazzi.

## 4. Edge Cases, Exceptions, and Caveats

### 4.1 Custom & Extreme Use Cases

- Guns built for extreme high-volume shooting or unusual disciplines may have:  
  - Higher or lower trigger weights.  
  - Different lubrication strategies.  
  - Specific ejector or extractor configurations.

**Caveat:**  
Assemblers must respect these requirements while ensuring all safety and reliability margins remain intact.

### 4.2 Retrofits & Post-Sale Adjustments

- Converting inertia triggers to mechanical, changing ejector behavior, or altering balance after delivery can involve revisiting assembly/QC considerations.

**Caveat:**  
Any such modifications should be re-subjected to the full **mechanical QC routine** to ensure safety is uncompromised.

### 4.3 Proof & Legal Mark Compliance

- If any work after proof could affect safety-critical parts, re-proof may be legally required in some jurisdictions.

**Caveat:**  
Assemblers and QC staff must be aware of proof requirements and coordinate with management and proof houses where applicable.

### 4.4 Damage or Faults Discovered Late

- Rarely, defects (e.g., latent wood cracks, hidden metal flaws) may only manifest at assembly or patterning stages.

**Caveat:**  
The policy at this level of gunmaking is typically to **fix correctly or start again**, not to ship a compromised product.

- **Upstream Stations (Conceptual Links):**  
  - **Design & Specification (Part II.A)** – defines mechanical and performance targets that assembly must achieve.  
  - **Action & Receiver Machining (Part II.B)** – determines underlying geometry for lock-up and internal fit.  
  - **Barrel Fabrication & Regulation (Part II.C)** – ensures barrels are safe and regulated; assembly confirms they integrate correctly.  
  - **Trigger Group & Lockwork Assembly (Part II.D)** – supplies tuned trigger mechanisms that must function correctly in assembled form.  
  - **Stock Selection, Shaping, Inletting, and Finishing (Parts II.E–II.I)** – provide fitted woodwork that must remain structurally sound after assembly.

- **Downstream / Related Sections:**  
  - **Pattern Testing & Regulation Confirmation (Part III – Patterning & Final Fit, conceptual)** – uses fully assembled gun to confirm POI and performance.  
  - **Customer Fitting & Handover (Part III)** – where fit and feel are finalized with the shooter, building on a mechanically sound platform.

- **Narrative Transition:**  
  - With assembly and mechanical QC complete, the gun is now a **fully functional, finished shotgun**. The next phases of the handbook (Part III) focus on **pattern testing, final fit adjustments, and customer-facing aspects** that validate and personalize all the work done in the factory.
