## 1. High-Level Overview

The Perazzi USA site is designed as a **digital atelier**—a place where a shooter, owner, or enthusiast can explore:

- Who Perazzi is and what the brand stands for.
- Which platforms and configurations might fit their discipline and style.
- What it means to commission or configure a Perazzi gun.
- How to care for, service, and live with a Perazzi over decades.

From a user’s perspective, the site is organized around a few core questions:

1. **"What is Perazzi, really?"** → Brand, heritage, champions, factory.
2. **"Which gun or platform is right for me?"** → Shotguns / platforms / concierge.
3. **"How do I build or configure my own Perazzi?"** → Bespoke build / concierge.
4. **"How do I look after my gun?"** → Service, parts, recommended centers.
5. **"Where do I shoot, watch, or connect with other Perazzi owners?"** → Events, athletes, stories.

Everything else flows from these core experiences.

## 2. Site Structure & Area Concepts

This section describes the main **site areas** from the user’s point of view. PerazziGPT should use these concepts when helping a user figure out where to go.

### 2.1 Primary Audiences

The site is designed to make sense for three primary user types:

- **Prospect** – A shooter who is curious about Perazzi and may be considering a first purchase.
- **Owner** – Someone who already owns a Perazzi and is looking for service, parts, upgrades, or deeper connection.
- **Enthusiast / Fan** – Someone interested in the history, factory, champions, or simply the world around Perazzi.

The same pages may serve more than one audience, but they should always feel coherent through these lenses.

### 2.2 Navigation Summary

At a high level, the site can be thought of as:

- **Home** – The cinematic welcome and brand overview.
- **Shotguns / Platforms** – The structured way to understand Perazzi platforms, disciplines, and configurations.
- **Bespoke Build / Concierge** – The guided experience for exploring or imagining a custom build.
- **Heritage** – History, factory, champions, and timeline.
- **Experience / Stories** – Articles, interviews, behind-the-scenes, and event coverage.
- **Service & Support** – Service centers, parts, care guidance, and ownership support.
- **Dealers & Events** – Where to see, handle, and shoot Perazzi in the real world.

PerazziGPT should use these buckets when answering questions like:

- "Where do I go to read about Perazzi history?"
- "Where can I compare platforms for sporting clays?"
- "Where do I find service info for my gun?"

### 2.3 Site Area Concepts

This subsection defines each major area concept more explicitly.

#### 2.3.1 Home

- **Purpose:** Welcome the user into the Perazzi world with a single, cinematic impression.
- **What the user can do here:**
  - Get a quick sense of Perazzi’s ethos and positioning.
  - See hero content that links into deeper areas (heritage, platforms, stories).
  - Understand that this is not a generic catalog site, but a brand-led experience.

#### 2.3.2 Shotguns / Platforms

- **Purpose:** Help users understand the **families of guns** Perazzi offers (e.g., MX, High Tech, TM, DC) and how they relate to disciplines and use cases.
- **What the user can do here:**
  - Explore platforms by discipline (trap, skeet, sporting, FITASC, live bird, etc.).
  - See the core differences between platforms in plain language.
  - Begin to form an idea of **which platform might be right for them**.

This is the area PerazziGPT should reference when users ask things like:

- "Which platform should I look at for sporting clays?"
- "Where can I compare MX8 and High Tech?"

#### 2.3.3 Bespoke Build / Concierge

- **Purpose:** Provide a guided, conversational way to explore what a **custom or configured Perazzi** could look like for the user.
- **What the user can do here:**
  - Walk through a structured journey (discipline → platform → gauge → rib → trigger → grade, etc.).
  - Understand the idea of **build paths** and how decisions stack.
  - Request or imagine a "next step" (talking to a dealer, fitter, or Perazzi representative).

PerazziGPT should think of this area as the **digital fitting table**—not for pricing or ordering directly, but for **clarifying preferences and direction**.

#### 2.3.4 Heritage

- **Purpose:** Tell the story of Perazzi—factory, founders, champions, and the long arc of success.
- **What the user can do here:**
  - Read about Perazzi’s origins and evolution.
  - See key championship wins, Olympic medals, and iconic shooters.
  - Explore factory imagery and possibly a heritage timeline.

Users looking for "why Perazzi?" or "what makes Perazzi different?" should often be directed here first.

#### 2.3.5 Experience / Stories

- **Purpose:** Show Perazzi in motion—on ranges, at championships, and in the lives of shooters.
- **What the user can do here:**
  - Read articles, interviews, or long-form stories.
  - See coverage from major events or behind-the-scenes features.
  - Get a feel for the **culture** around the brand.

PerazziGPT can reference this area when users want something less technical and more narrative.

#### 2.3.6 Service & Support

- **Purpose:** Support owners in keeping their guns safe, functional, and well cared for.
- **What the user can do here:**
  - Find recommended service centers and gunsmiths authorized by Perazzi.
  - Learn about care basics (cleaning, storage, inspection intervals) within safe, owner-level boundaries.
  - Understand how to approach more serious work via official channels.

For questions like "Where do I send my gun?" or "How do I get service?", this is the anchor.

#### 2.3.7 Dealers & Events

- **Purpose:** Connect users with physical places and events where Perazzi is present.
- **What the user can do here:**
  - Find dealers by region.
  - See scheduled events where Perazzi will have a presence.
  - Understand where they can handle guns, test platforms, or see Perazzi shooters in person.

PerazziGPT should use this when users want **real-world touchpoints**.
