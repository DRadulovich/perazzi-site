## 1. High-Level Overview

This document describes the **Stock Blank Selection & Rough Shaping station** in the Perazzi factory.

At this station, walnut blanks are selected and transformed into **rough-shaped stocks and fore-ends** that already embody the customer’s **fit dimensions** (length of pull, cast, drop, grip shape, etc.) and aesthetic grade, while preserving sufficient material for later **hand inletting and final shaping**.

This document explains:

- The **purpose** and **success criteria** of this station.
- The **inputs and outputs** (wood, specs, tools, and rough-shaped components).
- The **core knowledge and skills** required of the stockmaker.
- The main **decisions and trade-offs** (strength vs figure, oversize vs efficiency, cutting vs bending, etc.).
- The **tools and measurements** used at a conceptual level.
- Typical **failure modes** and how they are diagnosed and prevented.
- What **mastery** looks like in stock blank selection and rough shaping, including an illustrative vignette.

The focus is on how Perazzi balances **structural integrity**, **fit geometry**, and **aesthetic beauty** at the very first stage of turning wood into the gun’s furniture.

## 2. Key Concepts & Glossary

### 2.1 Roles and Station

- **Stock Blank Selection & Rough Shaping Station (canonical)**  
  - Synonyms: *Wood Room*, *Stock Roughing Station*, *Stock & Fore-end Rough Shaping*.  
  - Definition: Station where walnut blanks for stock and fore-end are selected, oriented, cut, and rough-shaped to incorporate customer dimensions while leaving material for final fitting.

- **Stockmaker / Stock Blank Selector (canonical)**  
  - Synonyms: *Stock Cutter*, *Wood Specialist*, *Stock Rougher*.  
  - Definition: Craftsperson who selects blanks, lays out patterns, operates duplicators/CNC for rough shaping, and ensures structural and aesthetic suitability.

### 2.2 Wood & Material Concepts

- **Walnut Blank**  
  - Dried, rough-sawn block of walnut prepared for stock or fore-end.  
  - Often high-grade Turkish or French walnut, air-dried and later conditioned in controlled rooms (e.g., 3–4 months at controlled humidity).

- **Figure / Grain Figure**  
  - Visual patterns in the wood (curl, fiddleback, marblecake, burl, etc.).  
  - Strongly influences aesthetics and grade (e.g., SC2, SC3, SCO).

- **Grain Flow / Grain Direction**  
  - Orientation of wood fibers.  
  - Critical for strength, especially through the **wrist** (narrow section behind the receiver).

- **Sapwood**  
  - Lighter outer wood that can indicate different mechanical or finishing behavior.  
  - Sometimes avoided in critical or highly visible areas.

- **Burl / Knot / Defect**  
  - Localized grain irregularities that can be visually striking but may weaken structure if placed in critical zones.

- **Wrist**  
  - Narrow section of stock behind the receiver where breakage risk is highest if grain orientation is poor.

- **Fore-end Blank**  
  - Smaller walnut blank for the fore-end; ideally matched to stock (same log or set) in color and figure.

- **Moisture Content**  
  - Degree of remaining water in the blank; ideally at a stable level (often around 8–10% conceptually).  
  - Affects stability and risk of warping after cutting.

### 2.3 Fit & Geometry Terms

- **Length of Pull (LOP)**  
  - Distance from trigger face to center of butt (heel or pad midpoint); primary length dimension of stock.

- **Drop at Comb / Drop at Heel**  
  - Vertical distance from the sighting plane (rib axis) to the comb and heel, respectively.  
  - Determines how high the shooter’s eye sits relative to rib.

- **Cast-Off / Cast-On**  
  - Lateral offset of the stock from the barrel/action centerline.  
  - Cast-off: butt moved to the right for right-handed shooters.  
  - Cast-on: butt moved to the left for left-handed shooters.

- **Pitch**  
  - Angle of the butt plate relative to the bore line; influences how the stock sits in the shoulder and how recoil is distributed.

- **Heel and Toe**  
  - Upper and lower corners of the butt end of the stock.

- **Grip / Wrist Shape**  
  - Geometry of the area where the shooting hand holds the stock; may include palm swell.

- **Monte Carlo Comb**  
  - Raised comb structure often used on trap stocks to maintain higher eye position.

### 2.4 Tools & Machine Concepts

- **Band Saw**  
  - Used to rough cut blank along layout lines for profile and plan views.

- **Stock Duplicator / Pantograph Copy Carver**  
  - Machine that traces a **pattern stock** with a stylus while a cutter reproduces the shape in the blank, often leaving extra material.

- **CNC Router / CNC Stock Machine**  
  - Computer-controlled machine that carves stock based on 3D CAD models, with parameters for drop, cast, LOP, etc.

- **Pattern Stock / Master Pattern**  
  - Reference stock used in duplicators as the shape template.

- **Templates / Layout Patterns**  
  - Flat templates used to mark stock outlines on blank surfaces.

- **Sacrificial Blocks**  
  - Extra wood pieces temporarily attached for clamping or fixturing, protecting the actual stock surfaces.

### 2.5 Measurement & Layout Concepts

- **Centerline / Reference Line**  
  - Marked line used to align stock geometry to blank (often representing bore or rib axis).

- **Layout Lines**  
  - Chalk or pencil lines marking side and top profiles of the stock within the blank.

- **Oversize Allowance**  
  - Additional material left on surfaces (e.g., 2–4 mm) for later hand-fitting and shaping.

- **Natural Cast**  
  - Cast built into stock orientation within the blank (by tilting layout) rather than added later by bending.

## 3. Main Content

### 3.1 Station Purpose & Success Criteria

#### 3.1.1 Purpose

The **Stock Blank Selection & Rough Shaping station** has two core purposes:

1. **Blank Selection**  
   - Choose walnut blanks (for stock and fore-end) that satisfy:  
     - Customer’s **aesthetic** desires (color, figure, character).  
     - **Structural** demands (correct grain flow through wrist, absence of critical defects, appropriate density).

2. **Rough Shaping to Customer Dimensions**  
   - Orient and machine the blank so that the rough stock and fore-end already embed the customer’s required:  
     - Length of pull.  
     - Drop at comb and heel.  
     - Cast at heel and toe.  
     - Grip style (e.g., trap vs field, palm swell).  
     - Fore-end shape (e.g., beavertail vs slim).

This stage converts a raw, rectangular block into a **recognizable but oversized stock** that can be test-mounted on an action and used for early fit checks.

#### 3.1.2 Success Criteria

This station is considered successful when:

- **Material criteria** are met:  
  - Blank has suitable density and grain flow, especially through wrist and fore-end latch areas.  
  - No disqualifying internal defects are present in critical zones (cracks, voids, sap pockets).  
  - Aesthetic grade (e.g., SC2, SC3, SCO) aligns with the customer’s order.

- **Geometric criteria** are met:  
  - Rough stock incorporates correct LOP, drop, cast, and basic grip geometry within **small margins of final spec**, while leaving safe oversize for hand fitting.  
  - The blank’s orientation ensures favorable grain flow (ideally parallel to direction of recoil through the wrist).  
  - Heel and toe location relative to grain are appropriate for intended cast and pitch.

- **Downstream work is enabled, not constrained**:  
  - Enough wood remains everywhere for inletting and final shaping, with no undersized regions.  
  - Rough inletting (if performed) is undersized and well-centered, not oversized or skewed.  
  - Fore-end rough shape aligns with barrel channel and iron requirements, with sufficient stock for later shaping.

When done perfectly, a rough-shaped stock already “feels” close to final when mounted on an action; only refinement and aesthetic shaping remain.

---

### 3.2 Inputs & Outputs

#### 3.2.1 Inputs

- **Walnut Blanks**  
  - Stock blanks and fore-end blanks, often from high-grade Turkish or French walnut.  
  - Air-dried and then conditioned (e.g., 3–4 months in controlled humidity rooms) with thousands of blanks in inventory.

- **Customer & Design Specifications**  
  - Fit data: LOP, drop at comb/heel, cast at heel/toe, pitch, grip size/shape, presence of Monte Carlo comb.  
  - Aesthetic grade: SC2, SC3, SCO, etc.  
  - Handedness: right- or left-handed (affects cast direction and grain considerations).

- **Patterns & Models**  
  - Pattern stocks for different disciplines (trap, skeet, sporting, field).  
  - CAD/CAM models or parametric templates for CNC-based shaping.

- **Machines & Tools (conceptual)**  
  - Band saws for rough cutting.  
  - Stock duplicators/pantograph carvers.  
  - CNC routers for advanced shaping.  
  - Clamps, vises, and fixturing systems (including sacrificial blocks for mounting).  
  - Layout tools: templates, straightedges, rulers, protractors, chalk/pencils.

- **Reference Fitting Data**  
  - Try-gun or adjustable prototype stock set to the customer’s fitted dimensions.  
  - Notes from fitting sessions.

- **Environmental & Wood Data**  
  - Moisture measurements or inferred dryness based on blank age and storage.

#### 3.2.2 Outputs

- **Rough-Shaped Stock**  
  - External shape: blocky but clearly recognizable stock profile (butt, comb, grip, wrist) with oversize allowances (e.g., a few millimeters) for final shaping.  
  - Internal: rough inletting for receiver and stock bolt, typically ~80% of final size/fit, with sufficient wood left for hand inletting.  
  - Extra length at butt for later trimming and recoil pad fitting; extra comb height for later fine tuning.

- **Rough-Shaped Fore-end**  
  - External: near-final outline (beavertail, field, etc.) with oversize.  
  - Internal: rough channel for barrels and space for fore-end iron and latch, sized conservatively for later hand fitting.

- **Offcuts & Inspection Clues**  
  - Removed wood pieces that reveal internal grain and defects; used to assess whether undesirable features have been safely cut away or remain near critical zones.

- **Reference Marks & Notes**  
  - Marked centerlines, cast directions, and notes on the wood (e.g., “leave +2 mm here,” “bending later,” or “preserve figure zone”) for later stages.

These outputs proceed to the **inletting and final shaping station**, where metal-to-wood fit is refined and exterior form is sculpted.

### 3.3 Core Knowledge & Skills

Stockmakers at this station need a blend of **wood science, geometry, machine operation, and aesthetic judgment**.

Key skills include:

#### 3.3.1 Wood Selection & Evaluation

- Judging walnut blanks for:  
  - **Density and weight** (by heft and feel).  
  - **Figure and color** (e.g., dark marblecake vs lighter, more uniform tone).  
  - **Hidden flaws** such as hairline cracks, small voids, sap pockets, or weak zones.  
- Reading grain direction to ensure strong grain flow through the wrist and fore-end latch area.  
- Balancing **beauty vs strength**: selecting blanks that offer both attractive figure and robust structure; rejecting visually spectacular blanks that are structurally marginal in critical areas.

#### 3.3.2 Layout & Template Use

- Orienting the stock within the blank in 3D, accounting for:  
  - Cast (often by tilting the stock shape within the blank for “natural cast”).  
  - Drop and pitch relative to a reference line representing the rib axis.  
- Marking side and top profiles using chalk/pencil and templates.  
- Visualizing how curves (butt, comb, grip) will emerge from the slab and ensuring sufficient margin for final shaping.

#### 3.3.3 Machine Operation (Duplicator / CNC)

- **Pantograph/duplicator operation**:  
  - Tracing pattern stock smoothly and evenly to avoid over-cutting.  
  - Adjusting cut depth and offset to leave specified oversize.  
- **CNC operation**:  
  - Setting up blanks with correct orientation and fixturing.  
  - Using or adjusting programs to reflect individual customer dimensions.  
  - Selecting feeds and speeds that minimize tear-out, especially in highly figured areas.

#### 3.3.4 Understanding Stock Geometry & Fit

- Translating measurement data (LOP, drop, cast) into physical geometry on the wood.  
- For example:  
  - Ensuring comb height corresponds to drop at comb above bore line.  
  - Achieving correct LOP from trigger to butt (with planned extra length).  
  - Incorporating Monte Carlo profiles for trap stocks.  
- Using try-gun or prototype stocks as 3D references and aligning rough stocks accordingly.

#### 3.3.5 Efficient, Safe Material Removal

- Removing bulk material with band saw and machines without causing splits or large chips.  
- Anticipating grain direction and cutting “with the grain” where possible to reduce tear-out.  
- Knowing how much material to leave on:  
  - Exterior surfaces (e.g., a few millimeters on comb, cheekpiece, and grip).  
  - Inletting surfaces (e.g., leaving undersize for tight fit).

#### 3.3.6 Fore-end-Specific Considerations

- Selecting and orienting fore-end blanks to minimize warp and ensure strength near latch and iron.  
- Matching color and figure to the butt stock (often from the same log, set, or visually matched blank).  
- Roughing the fore-end concurrently so style and proportion match the stock.

#### 3.3.7 Tool Setup & Maintenance

- Keeping cutters sharp to avoid burning walnut or causing tear-out.  
- Securing blanks properly with padded clamps to prevent dents or marks.  
- Planning fixturing to allow maximum machining in one setup, minimizing risky repositioning.

#### 3.3.8 Joinery & Inletting Awareness

- Understanding how the stock will mate to the action and where wood must be preserved for inletting.  
- Ensuring duplicator/CNC cuts inletting undersize and well-centered.  
- Avoiding any oversize internal cuts that would compromise later hand fit.

#### 3.3.9 Moisture and Stability Awareness

- Recognizing wood that may still be “green” or unstable.  
- Using intuition and experience (feel, sound when tapped) to assess if a blank is truly seasoned.  
- Knowing when to set aside a blank for additional drying instead of rushing into shaping.

---

### 3.4 Decisions & Trade-Offs

The stockmaker constantly balances **strength, aesthetics, efficiency, and future adjustability**.

#### 3.4.1 Grain Strength vs Figure Display

- Highly figured blanks (burl, strong curl) can have irregular grain that weakens the wrist.  
- Trade-off:  
  - **Favor strength** by orienting the stock so grain runs through the wrist, even if it sacrifices some striking figure.  
  - Seek blanks where figure and grain strength coincide to minimize compromise.  
- Example: If strong cast-off is required, the stockmaker may retain slightly more wrist thickness to compensate for thinner sections created by cast geometry.

#### 3.4.2 Blank Usage vs Waste

- High-grade walnut is expensive and scarce.  
- Decisions include:  
  - Whether to cut fore-end from same blank (perfect color match) or from a separate but matching blank (better structural layout).  
  - How to position the stock within the blank to minimize waste while preserving safety margins and aesthetics.

#### 3.4.3 Oversize Dimensions vs Efficiency

- Leaving more oversize:  
  - Pros: maximum safety margin for final shaping and fit; easier to correct minor errors or movement.  
  - Cons: more labor later for hand shaping.

- Leaving less oversize:  
  - Pros: less hand work; higher efficiency.  
  - Cons: little room to correct errors or accommodate wood movement; high risk with expensive blanks.

**Practical approach:**  
- Err on the side of leaving safe oversize (e.g., a few millimeters externally and undersize in inletting), especially for high-grade blanks, since extra labor is preferred over scrapping costly wood.

#### 3.4.4 Inletting Now vs Later

- Heavier machine inletting:  
  - Pros: saves time if perfectly aligned.  
  - Cons: risky if slightly off; wood cannot be added back.

- Minimal inletting:  
  - Pros: more flexible and safer for custom fit; more work later.  
  - Cons: requires more hand chiseling and scraping.

**Practical approach:**  
- Frequently perform partial inletting by machine (e.g., rough central cavity and stock bolt path) and leave final close fit to hand inletting.

#### 3.4.5 Cutting Geometry vs Later Bending

- Cutting cast and drop directly from the blank:  
  - Pros: clean geometry, uses natural grain and avoids later bending stress.  
  - Cons: limited by blank dimensions; may not reach extreme adjustments.

- Bending (post-shaping heat/steam/oil) for fine-tuning:  
  - Pros: adds flexibility to adjust cast/drop after test shooting.  
  - Cons: introduces internal stress and requires care; best used as a fine adjustment, not major offset.

**Practical approach:**  
- Build in most of the cast and drop in the cut layout, using blank orientation, and reserve bending for smaller corrections after the shooter tests the gun.

#### 3.4.6 Fore-end Style & Customization

- Deciding how much of fore-end style (beavertail vs slim field; palm swell area) to define in rough shaping vs leaving to hand carving.  
- For heavily customized requests, often leave more wood for later personalization.

---

### 3.5 Tools & Measurements (Conceptual Level)

#### 3.5.1 Cutting & Shaping Tools

- **Band Saw**  
  - Used to cut rough side and top profiles following layout lines.

- **Stock Duplicator / Pantograph**  
  - Copies pattern stock shape into blank, leaving predetermined oversize.

- **CNC Stock Machine**  
  - Uses digital models and parameterized inputs (LOP, drop, cast) to carve stock and fore-end.

- **Hand Tools** (for touch-ups)  
  - Rasps and coarse files for local adjustments.  
  - Chisels and gouges for specific rough inletting or detail refinement.

#### 3.5.2 Layout & Measurement Tools

- **Straightedges & Rulers**  
  - Used to represent bore/rib axis and measure drop to comb/heel.

- **Protractors / Angle Gauges**  
  - Used conceptually to define pitch and cast angles, especially during layout.

- **Templates & Patterns**  
  - Butt, comb, and grip outline templates; metal or wood patterns to trace outlines.

- **Marking Tools**  
  - Chalk, pencils, and marking gauges to lay down lines on rough, uneven blanks.

- **Calipers & Compasses**  
  - Spot-check thickness of wood left in critical areas (e.g., comb, wrist) after roughing.

- **Moisture Meter (conceptual)**  
  - To verify blanks are within desired moisture content range.

#### 3.5.3 Fit Reference Tools

- **Try-Gun / Adjustable Stock**  
  - Used as an embodied reference for customer’s fit; shapes and dimensions are mirrored in CAD/patterns.

- **Test Action or “Shop Action”**  
  - Receiver used to mount rough stock for initial sanity checks of alignment and feel.

- **Human Feedback**  
  - Stockmaker’s own mount and shoulder feel as a quick qualitative check of cast, drop, and pitch.

#### 3.5.4 Key Measurements Controlled Here

- LOP (with built-in extra length at butt).  
- Drop at comb and heel (with comb left slightly high for later lowering).  
- Cast at heel and toe (with allowance for minor later adjustment).  
- Initial inletting depth and centering relative to action geometry.

---

### 3.6 Failure Modes & Diagnosis

This station actively prevents problems that would be costly or impossible to fix later.

Representative failure modes include:

1. **Stock Blank Flaw Discovered Late**
   - Example: hidden crack or void becomes visible when cutting near wrist or head.  
   - Diagnosis: visual inspection of fresh surfaces and offcuts; tapping to compare sound (sharp ring vs dull thud).  
   - Outcome:  
     - If flaw lies in critical zone (wrist, head) and cannot be carved away, blank must be rejected and replaced.  
     - Stockmaker notes issue in production records and selects a new blank of similar grade.

2. **Mis-Cut or Measurement Error**
   - Example: wrong pattern or CNC program used; comb cut too low; cast cut in the wrong direction.  
   - Diagnosis: measuring finished rough dimensions against spec; mounting on action and visually assessing alignment.  
   - Outcome:  
     - If too much wood has been removed in the wrong place (e.g., comb too low, inletting oversized), the stock is usually scrapped.  
     - Prevented by double-checking patterns and programs before cutting, especially on high-grade blanks.

3. **Tear-Out or Chip-Out**
   - Example: grain splinters near thin edges, butt corners, or head during cutting.  
   - Diagnosis: visual inspection and light sanding to reveal extent of damage.  
   - Outcome:  
     - Minor chips in internal or covered areas may be glued back and become invisible under fit.  
     - Visible, deep chips in exposed areas are often unacceptable; may require starting over with a new blank.

4. **Misaligned Inletting**
   - Example: rough inletting is off-center or skewed, causing uneven wall thickness around action.  
   - Diagnosis: test-fitting receiver or test action, measuring side-to-side thickness.  
   - Outcome:  
     - If within correctable margin, careful hand inletting can bring it to center.  
     - If off too far, the stock may end up too thin on one side, requiring rejection.

5. **Stock Warp After Cutting**
   - Example: blank moves slightly after heavy material removal due to residual internal stresses.  
   - Diagnosis: checking straightness of centerline and fit to action after a rest period (often letting rough stock “rest” overnight or longer).  
   - Outcome:  
     - Minor movement can be compensated by subsequent shaping or controlled bending.  
     - Significant warp may render stock unsuitable.

6. **Fore-end Color or Grain Mismatch**
   - Example: fore-end appears too different from stock after rough shaping.  
   - Diagnosis: visual comparison of rough pieces.  
   - Outcome:  
     - Minor differences can be mitigated later with stain.  
     - Large, aesthetically jarring mismatches may prompt selection of a different fore-end blank.

7. **Dimension Issues Discovered in Test Fitting**
   - Example: rough stock mounted to action reveals drop or cast outside intended adjustment margin.  
   - Diagnosis: measuring actual geometry on action; shoulder checks by skilled staff.  
   - Outcome:  
     - If within margin, later shaping and/or bending can correct it.  
     - If outside margin (e.g., comb too low), stock may be scrapped and restarted.

The station relies heavily on **early detection** and **conservative margins** to avoid losing high-value blanks at later, more labor-intensive stages.

### 3.7 What Mastery Looks Like

Mastery in this station is expressed in **intuitive wood judgment**, **confident machine use**, and **thoughtful coordination with downstream craftspeople**.

#### 3.7.1 Intuition for Wood

- Ability to scan a rack of blanks and quickly identify those best suited for a particular customer’s aesthetic and usage needs.  
- Recognizing subtle cues (color changes, grain shifts) that hint at potential sap pockets or weakness.  
- Knowing which regions’ walnut tends to be denser or softer and choosing accordingly for heavy-recoil vs lighter-duty guns.

#### 3.7.2 Speed with Confidence

- Comfort cutting extremely high-grade blanks without hesitation because layout, machine settings, and methods are trusted.  
- Minimizing scrap due to human error; masters rarely ruin a top-grade blank.  
- Testing new machine programs on lower-grade or scrap pieces before committing expensive blanks.

#### 3.7.3 Aesthetic & Ergonomic Foresight

- Adjusting layout slightly to highlight beautiful figure while maintaining structural safety.  
- Leaving extra material in places where future ergonomic enhancements may be requested (e.g., potential palm swell).  
- Anticipating how figure will appear under finish and shaping stock lines to showcase it.

#### 3.7.4 Sensitive Machine Handling

- Modulating feed speed and depth of cut based on local grain behavior (e.g., slowing when cutter approaches burl or highly figured sections).  
- Performing shallow passes first on tricky areas to reduce risk of tear-out before full-depth cuts.  
- Treating each blank individually rather than running them as identical parts.

#### 3.7.5 Collaboration with Fitters and Finishers

- Communicating with the stock fitter about:  
  - Areas left intentionally oversize (e.g., “extra 2 mm on comb for possible lowering”).  
  - Special figure to preserve (“beautiful streak on right side—keep it in cheekpiece if possible”).  
- Keeping mental or written notes on specific blanks (e.g., from a particular tree or log) and sharing these stories with customers when relevant.

#### 3.7.6 Example Vignette: Matching Person to Wood

> **Example vignette (composite, illustrative):**  
> A customer visits the wood room to choose a blank. The master stockmaker listens: “I like darker wood with strong marblecake figure, but I shoot heavy loads and don’t want it to crack.” From a wall of blanks, he pulls three candidates within minutes. To reveal the finished look, he lightly wets a section with alcohol or mineral spirits; the figure “pops” into view. The customer points to one, and the master nods—it is the same one he would have chosen. Later, as he lays out the pattern, he angles the stock so grain runs cleanly through the wrist while still placing the most dramatic figure across the butt and comb. The customer eventually shoulders the rough stock and feels it already sits correctly; the wood looks exactly as imagined. This ability to bridge customer preference, structural needs, and long-term experience is the hallmark of mastery at this station.

## 4. Edge Cases, Exceptions, and Caveats

This section consolidates scenarios requiring extra care in stock blank selection and rough shaping.

### 4.1 Marginally Seasoned or “Suspicious” Blanks

- If a blank appears slightly too green or unstable (by moisture reading or feel/sound), it may be:  
  - Set aside for further drying.  
  - Used only for non-critical parts (rare in a high-end context).

**Caveat:**  
Better to delay use than risk warp or cracking after shaping.

### 4.2 Extreme Cast or Drop Requirements

- Customers with highly unusual fit dimensions (extreme cast or drop) may push blank geometry limits.  
- Stockmaker may need to:  
  - Choose larger or particularly straight-grained blanks.  
  - Use a combination of cut geometry and later bending to achieve final spec.

**Caveat:**  
Careful communication with fitter and customer is needed to set expectations about how much adjustment is feasible.

### 4.3 Very High-Grade Exhibition Wood

- Extra-grade blanks with spectacular figure are both costly and more failure-sensitive.  
- Additional precautions:  
  - Triple-check machine settings.  
  - Consider test runs on lower-grade blanks with similar dimensions.  
  - Leave slightly more oversize margin than usual.

### 4.4 Matching Multiple Guns or Sets

- For customers ordering multiple guns with matched wood, selection and layout must consider:  
  - Matching tone and figure across multiple stocks and fore-ends.  
  - Consistency in wrist strength across the set.

### 4.5 Fore-end Heat and Warp Considerations

- Fore-ends see heat from barrels; grain orientation and thickness must account for potential movement.  
- Special care for high-volume competition guns where fore-ends are exposed to repeated heat cycles.

## 5. References & Cross-Links

- **Upstream:**  
  - **Design & Specification Station (Product Engineering)** – provides fit dimensions, stock style, and aesthetic grade requirements.  
  - **Trigger Group & Lockwork Assembly** – indirectly influences stock geometry (trigger reach, blade position).

- **Lateral:**  
  - **Barrel Fabrication & Regulation** – influences overall gun balance; barrel weight informs desired stock weight and density.

- **Downstream:**  
  - **Stock Inletting & Final Shaping Station** – performs precise metal-to-wood fit and sculpts final stock and fore-end contours.  
  - **Checkering & Finishing Station** – relies on stable, well-prepared surfaces and preserved figure.

- **Narrative Transition:**  
  - With stock and fore-end rough-shaped and oriented correctly in the wood, the next stage in the handbook follows the **inletting and final shaping** process, where wood and metal are married in a seamless fit and the rough block becomes the elegant furniture of a finished Perazzi shotgun.
