## 1. High-Level Overview

This document describes the **Final Fitting & Customer-Specific Adjustments** station in the Perazzi factory.

At this station, a **nearly finished shotgun** is fine‑tuned to the **individual shooter**. The gun has already passed machining, regulation, stocking, finishing, and mechanical QC; final fitting refines:

- **Stock geometry** (length of pull, drop, cast, pitch, comb height and thickness, toe angle).
- **Balance and weight distribution**.
- **Trigger reach and feel**.
- **Recoil pad choice, shape, and interface with the shoulder**.
- Subtle **comfort and mount characteristics** that only become fully visible when the shooter mounts and fires the gun.

For made‑to‑measure and bespoke guns this step is highly interactive and often occurs with the customer present; for standard‑spec guns or remote buyers it may be minimal or handled via measurement data.

The station is successful when the shooter can mount the gun comfortably, see the correct sight picture, and have the **gun shoot where they look**—with no distracting discomfort or ergonomic compromises. This is also where the gun becomes **“the shooter’s gun”** rather than just a generic example of the model.

## 2. Key Concepts & Glossary

### 2.1 Roles and Station

- **Final Fitting & Customer-Specific Adjustments Station (canonical)**  
  - Synonyms: *Final Fitting Bench*, *Customer Fitting*, *Personal Fit Station*.  
  - Definition: Station where the nearly finished shotgun is adjusted to match the individual shooter’s physique, preferences, and real‑world performance.

- **Fitter / Final Fitting Specialist (canonical)**  
  - Synonyms: *Gun Fitter*, *Stock Fitter*, *Perazzi Experience Fitter*.  
  - Definition: Craftsperson who interprets shooter feedback and pattern results, makes small but critical mechanical and stock adjustments, and coaches the shooter through the fitting process.

### 2.2 Fit & Geometry Concepts

- **Length of Pull (LOP)**  
  - Distance from trigger face to center of butt/pad; strongly affects mount comfort, trigger reach, and recoil distribution.

- **Drop (Comb & Heel)**  
  - Vertical distance between the sighting plane and the comb/heel; determines eye height and basic point of impact (POI) for a given sight picture.

- **Cast (Cast-Off / Cast-On)**  
  - Lateral offset of the stock from the barrel/action centerline.  
  - Cast-off (right-handed) moves stock to the right; cast-on (left-handed) to the left.  
  - Affects lateral eye alignment and how the recoil pad seats in the shoulder pocket.

- **Pitch**  
  - Angle of the butt/pad relative to the bore; influences how pad contacts the shoulder and how recoil is distributed (toe vs heel dig, muzzle rise).

- **Toe & Heel**  
  - Toe: lower rear corner of the butt/pad.  
  - Heel: upper rear corner.  
  - Toe angle and pad shape impact how smoothly the gun mounts and whether the pad catches on clothing.

- **Comb Height & Thickness**  
  - Height: influences vertical POI and sight picture (how much rib the shooter sees).  
  - Thickness/edge shape: affects cheek comfort and bruising risk.

### 2.3 Adjustment & Hardware Concepts

- **Adjustable Comb**  
  - Hardware allowing comb to move up/down (height) and sometimes sideways (cast at comb).  
  - Adjusted with hex keys or screwdrivers; often includes posts, locking screws, and optional spacers/shims.

- **Stock Bending**  
  - Controlled bending of the finished stock (typically at the wrist) using heat and a bending jig to change cast and/or drop by small amounts.  
  - Requires knowledge of wood behavior and finish tolerance.

- **Recoil Pad & Spacers**  
  - Pad: rubber or synthetic butt piece that softens recoil and defines butt shape.  
  - Spacers: flat or tapered inserts between stock and pad to adjust LOP and/or pitch (e.g., 1/8", 1/4").

- **Weight & Balance Adjustments**  
  - Additional weight (e.g., inserted in stock bolt hole) to shift balance rearward or change total gun weight.  
  - Sometimes barrel weights if needed.

- **Adjustable Trigger Shoe**  
  - Trigger blade that can slide fore/aft on a rail to adjust trigger reach relative to LOP and grip size.

### 2.4 Performance & Experience Concepts

- **Point of Impact (POI) vs Sight Picture**  
  - Relationship between where the shooter **sees** the target over the rib and where the pattern centers.  
  - Final fitting ensures POI matches the shooter’s desired sight picture (e.g., floating targets vs covering them).

- **Comfort & Recoil Management**  
  - Distribution of recoil across shoulder and cheek.  
  - Fit can significantly reduce perceived recoil by aligning pad and comb with the shooter’s body.

- **Natural Mount & Swing**  
  - The gun should come to the shoulder and cheek **without conscious adjustment**, and track targets smoothly.  
  - Final fitting tunes stock geometry until mount and swing feel intuitive.

### 2.5 Process & Interaction Concepts

- **Perazzi Experience Visit (conceptual)**  
  - A factory visit where the shooter works with a fitter for a morning or day (often including a tour), test‑shoots, and has the gun adjusted live.

- **“Better or Worse?” Iteration**  
  - The fitter’s method of making small adjustments, then having the shooter mount or shoot again to compare comfort and POI.

- **Overfitting**  
  - Adjusting past the point of practical benefit, possibly confusing the shooter or reducing consistency.

## 3. Main Content

### 3.1 Station Purpose & Success Criteria

#### 3.1.1 Purpose

The **Final Fitting & Customer-Specific Adjustments** station:

- Takes a gun built to **initial measurements or standard spec** and aligns it with the **actual shooter** using it.  
- Fine‑tunes stock geometry (LOP, drop, cast, pitch, toe angle, comb height/width) and trigger reach/feel.  
- Adjusts **balance and weight** with small additions or removals.  
- Tailors subjective details such as pad type, pad edge rounding, and minor ergonomics so the gun mounts and swings naturally.  
- Confirms real‑world shooting comfort and performance via pattern board checks or shooting clay targets.

#### 3.1.2 Success Criteria

A fitting is considered successful when:

- **Eye Alignment & POI**  
  - When the shooter mounts naturally, their eye is correctly aligned with the rib; they are not forced to tilt or stretch.  
  - Pattern or live‑target results confirm the gun **shoots where they look**, for both barrels and with their chosen sight picture (e.g., specific amount of rib showing).

- **Comfort & Recoil Behavior**  
  - Recoil pad seats properly in the shoulder pocket without digging at toe or heel; no slipping on mount.  
  - Cheek contact is firm but not bruising; comb edges do not cause discomfort.  
  - After many shots, the shooter does not suffer unnecessary bruises or strain attributable to fit.

- **Control & Trigger Reach**  
  - Shooter can reach trigger comfortably with the pad of the finger, without stretching or cramping.  
  - The gun remains stable and controllable through the shot and recovery.

- **Balance & Swing**  
  - Gun feels neutrally or appropriately balanced for the shooter’s discipline and preference (not uncomfortably muzzle‑heavy or butt‑heavy, unless specifically desired).  
  - Swing and target transitions feel natural.

- **Subjective Satisfaction**  
  - Shooter expresses confidence and comfort (“It feels perfect” / “It feels like part of me”).  
  - On clays or test targets, shooter’s hit rate improves or meets expectations.

In structured terms, a good fit produces **correct POI**, **no ergonomically induced discomfort**, and **repeatable shooting performance**.

#### 3.2.2 Outputs

- **Final Adjusted Gun**  
  - Comb height and (if applicable) comb cast set and locked.  
  - Stock cast and drop finalized, via adjustable comb or bending as needed.  
  - LOP set with spacers or pad choice; trigger shoe position adjusted to match.  
  - Pitch refined (via tapered spacers or pad trimming) to improve pad contact and recoil feel.  
  - Balance tuned, with weights added/removed if needed.

- **Comfort & Mount Improvements**  
  - Pad edges and toe/heel shaped or softened so the gun mounts smoothly without catching clothing.  
  - Minor ergonomic refinements such as small comb edge rounding or subtle cheek comfort tweaks.

- **Documentation & Records**  
  - Final geometry recorded (LOP, drop at comb/heel, cast at heel/toe, pitch, comb hardware settings, trigger shoe position).  
  - Notes on subjective feedback and how it was addressed (e.g., “preferred slightly heavier butt; added stock weight”).

### 3.3 Core Knowledge & Skills

#### 3.3.1 Shotgun Fitting Expertise

- Understands relationships between **stock dimensions** and **shot placement**:  
  - Left/right hits vs cast.  
  - High/low hits vs comb height/drop and sometimes pitch.  
- Interprets pattern and target results in light of fit rather than only shooter technique.  
- Uses an iterative approach similar to an optometrist: small changes followed by **“better or worse?”** checks.

#### 3.3.2 Communication & Coaching

- Observes the shooter’s **mount and posture**, not just target hits.  
- Politely coaches mounting technique while distinguishing between **technique issues** and **fit issues**.  
- Manages subjective feedback (“feels stiff”, “kicks a bit”) and explains what can and cannot be altered by fit vs physics (e.g., inherent recoil of a light gun).

#### 3.3.3 Bending & Modification Skills

- Uses bending jigs safely to make **small changes** in cast or drop by heating the wrist and applying controlled pressure.  
- Understands wood behavior:  
  - Spring-back after bending.  
  - Grain direction and how it affects bending limits.  
- Knows approximate limits for safe bending (small millimeter‑level changes) and when bending becomes too risky for a finished stock.  
- Chooses alternatives (e.g., relying on adjustable comb, or more conservative changes) when bending risk outweighs benefit.

#### 3.3.4 Recoil Pad Fitting & Pad Adjustments

- Selects pad type (brand, hardness, profile) based on shooter preference and recoil needs.  
- Uses spacers to adjust LOP and pitch without cutting wood when possible.  
- Fits spacers and pads cleanly so they follow the butt outline and remain flush.  
- Performs quick pad modifications (e.g., rounding pad toe or heel) to prevent pad catching on mount.

#### 3.3.5 Trigger & Action Adjustments for Comfort

- Adjusts **trigger shoe position** so the shooter’s finger pad lands naturally on the trigger.  
- Can, within safety margins, slightly lighten or increase trigger pull at the shooter’s request.  
- Ensures that changing LOP is coordinated with trigger reach and that triggers still **reset and function** correctly after adjustments.  
- When possible, swaps trigger blade shape (more curve vs flatter) to suit preference.

#### 3.3.6 Balance & Weight Tuning

- Evaluates shooter’s comment such as “feels muzzle‑heavy” or “feels too light.”  
- Uses stock bolt hole weights or other internal additions to increase butt weight and shift balance.  
- Considers effect of added weight on overall handling and recoil.  
- Recognizes when weight complaints are likely to diminish as the shooter becomes accustomed to the gun vs when change is genuinely warranted.

#### 3.3.7 Fine Ergonomics & Comfort Adjustments

- Identifies subtle discomfort sources:  
  - Sharp comb edges against cheek.  
  - Excessive palm swell, or grip too full/small.  
- Performs **micro‑shaping** (small sanding and re‑oiling) on limited areas when this yields significant comfort gains without major re-checkering or refinishing.  
- Suggests non‑invasive options such as leather comb covers when more dramatic carving is not appropriate at this stage.

#### 3.3.8 Confidence Building & Reassurance

- Helps shooters trust their gun by:  
  - Orchestrating successful target sequences after adjustments (“Now I’m smoking them”).  
  - Explaining the reasons behind changes and what they should feel.  
- Knows when to **stop adjusting** and encourage the shooter to settle in with the current setup rather than chase diminishing returns.

#### 3.3.9 Time Management & Prioritization

- Often works within limited windows (e.g., an hour or two, or a Perazzi Experience time block).  
- Prioritizes **high‑impact adjustments** (comb height/cast, LOP, pitch) before minor refinements.  
- Avoids getting bogged down in small details that will not materially affect outcome or that may be better refined after the shooter has some time with the gun.

---

### 3.4 Decisions & Trade-Offs

#### 3.4.1 Which Adjustments to Prioritize

- Focus first on **comb height/cast** and **LOP**, as they most directly influence POI and comfort.  
- Decide whether cast should be changed via:  
  - Adjustable comb offset (affects cheek position), or  
  - Full stock bending (affects both cheek alignment and pad placement).  
- Consider whether the shooter can adapt to a small cast or drop discrepancy vs subjecting a finished stock to bending risk.

#### 3.4.2 Permanent vs Temporary Solutions

- Chooses **reversible fixes** (spacers, adjustable comb tweaks, stick‑on risers) when shooter’s preferences may evolve with experience.  
- Uses more permanent methods (bending, cutting stock) when there is clear, consistent need and when temporary options are insufficient.

#### 3.4.3 Fit vs Recoil Management

- Uses fit to **mitigate recoil** by:  
  - Adjusting pitch so pad fully contacts the shoulder.  
  - Ensuring pad shape and mounting avoid hotspots.  
- Balances shooter’s desire for “less recoil” with realistic limits of gun weight and load choice.  
- Decides when to adjust pitch immediately (e.g., clear toe dig and bruising) vs when to suggest trying the gun more before chasing minor comfort issues.

#### 3.4.4 Cosmetic Impact vs Functional Gain

- Some adjustments (bending, small sanding) may slightly affect finish.  
- Fitter weighs whether the **functional improvement** justifies risk of minor cosmetic change, especially on high‑grade guns.  
- Uses touch‑up and re‑oiling to make any necessary cosmetic impact as invisible as possible.

#### 3.4.5 When to Stop Adjusting

- Avoids **overfitting**, where constant tiny changes can erode shooter confidence.  
- Stops when:  
  - Fit is objectively within optimal ranges.  
  - Shooter is breaking targets well and expressing comfort.  
- Explains that further tiny tweaks may not yield improvement and can be revisited later if needed.

#### 3.4.6 Defer or Decline Major Changes at Final Stage

- For large issues such as “too heavy”, recognizes that only limited adjustments are possible at this stage.  
- Suggests a **break‑in period** for the shooter to adapt before making drastic changes.  
- Avoids extreme weight‑removal or geometry changes on a finished, fully finished gun unless they are clearly necessary.

#### 3.4.7 Follow-Up Plan & Future Adjustability

- Communicates that certain aspects (e.g., comb height on adjustable hardware) can be revisited after the shooter has fired a few hundred targets.  
- Ensures final records allow future replication (for a second gun or replacement stock) or systematic follow‑up adjustments.

---

### 3.5 Tools & Measurements (Conceptual Level)

#### 3.5.1 Stock & Comb Adjustment Tools

- Adjustable comb hardware tools (hex keys, screwdrivers).  
- Spacers and shims (flat for LOP, tapered for pitch).  
- Bending jack for the stock wrist, with associated heat source (infrared lamp, heat gun, steam, hot oil).

#### 3.5.2 Recoil Pad & Butt-End Tools

- Variety of recoil pads (different thicknesses, materials, profiles).  
- Spacers cut to butt outline.  
- Belt sander or equivalent for pad shaping and edge blending.  
- Screwdrivers and, if used, torque tools for pad screws.

#### 3.5.3 Measurement Tools

- Tape measure or rule for LOP and reference dimensions.  
- Inclinometer or pitch meter for pad angle.  
- Reference patterns or forms for standard stock geometries.

#### 3.5.4 Balance & Weight Tools

- Small internal weights or tubes for stock bolt channel.  
- Simple scale to gauge added weight and overall gun weight.

#### 3.5.5 Test & Evaluation Tools

- Pattern plate/target or laser bore pointer for quick POI checks.  
- Clay targets and trap/sporting setup for functional testing.  
- Fitter’s notebook or record sheet for final dimensions and notes.

### 3.6 Failure Modes & Diagnosis

#### 3.6.1 Customer Discomfort or Dissatisfaction

- **Symptoms:** Shooter still feels “not right” or experiences discomfort despite adjustments.  
- **Diagnosis:**  
  - Differentiate between fit problems and mount/technique issues via observation and pattern tests.  
  - Consider eye dominance issues or other shooter‑specific factors beyond stock geometry.  
- **Response:**  
  - Systematically evaluate one fit parameter at a time.  
  - Offer coaching or suggest minor technique changes where appropriate.  
  - Be transparent about which issues are fixable by fit and which are not.

#### 3.6.2 Over-Bending or Stock Breakage

- **Symptoms:** Audible crack; visible fracture in the stock, especially at the wrist.  
- **Cause:** Excessive bending force, insufficient heat/conditioning, or unfavorable grain.  
- **Response:**  
  - For minor cracks, carefully repair (e.g., adhesive and refinish) if structurally acceptable.  
  - For serious damage, stock replacement and restarting fit on a new blank.  
  - Prevention via conservative bends and respect for wood limits.

#### 3.6.3 Finish Damage During Adjustments

- **Symptoms:** Scratches, dull spots, or crazing of finish caused by tools, bending, or sanding.  
- **Response:**  
  - Local re‑oiling, polishing, or small refinishing patches to blend defects.  
  - Prevent by protecting surfaces during mechanical operations and using careful tool handling.

#### 3.6.4 Loose Hardware After Shooting

- **Symptoms:** Comb or pad hardware loosens after initial shooting; settings drift.  
- **Response:**  
  - Retighten hardware after test session.  
  - Use friction‑adding elements (e.g., leather, silicone, or similar) where appropriate to help keep comb from shifting.  
  - Instruct shooter to re‑check tightness periodically.

#### 3.6.5 Unintended Side Effects of Adjustments

- **Examples:**  
  - Raising comb enough to improve POI, but now creating cheek slap.  
  - Adjusting cast such that recoil pad toe digs more into the chest.  
- **Response:**  
  - Holistically reassess geometry: adjust comb shape, pad shape, or pitch to smooth out side effects.  
  - Re‑mount and dry‑mount multiple times after each change to check for new issues.

#### 3.6.6 Trigger & Action Issues After Fit Changes

- **Symptoms:** After major LOP or pad changes, trigger reach or feel becomes suboptimal.  
- **Response:**  
  - Re‑position trigger shoe to restore comfort.  
  - Confirm triggers still reset correctly and remain within safe pull weight ranges.

#### 3.6.7 Documentation Errors

- **Symptoms:** Final stock dimensions or adjustments not captured accurately in records.  
- **Consequences:** Future service or replication (e.g., second gun) may be built to old/incorrect specs.  
- **Response:**  
  - Careful updating of build or fitting sheet after changes.  
  - Treat record keeping as part of the fitting process, not an afterthought.

---

### 3.7 What Mastery Looks Like

#### 3.7.1 Fitter as Coach and Interpreter

- Master fitters act as both **technicians** and **coaches**.  
- They read the shooter’s body language, results, and feedback and translate these into specific adjustments.  
- They provide calm, confident guidance that helps the shooter relax and trust the process.

#### 3.7.2 Knowing When Good is Good Enough

- Resist the temptation to chase textbook numbers when the shooter is already performing well.  
- Recognize when additional changes would mainly add complexity rather than benefit.  
- Prefer stable, repeatable configurations that shooters can internalize over time.

#### 3.7.3 Subtle, Invisible Touches

- Apply small refinements the shooter may never consciously notice, such as:  
  - Adding friction material under comb hardware so it never creeps under recoil.  
  - Securing balance weights so they do not rattle.  
- These details contribute to **long‑term satisfaction** even though they rarely get explicit credit.

#### 3.7.4 Memory & Record-Keeping of Customer Preferences

- Maintain detailed records so that:  
  - Future adjustments or repairs can be made intelligently.  
  - A second gun can be built to match a favored first gun’s fit.  
- Sometimes remember individual shooters and their “feel” preferences beyond raw numbers.

#### 3.7.5 Handling Diverse Anatomies & Use Cases

- Experience fitting shooters of **different builds** (e.g., youth, women, unusual proportions).  
- Adjust LOP, pitch, cast, and grip feel to accommodate unique anatomies while preserving structural integrity.  
- When necessary, suggest or perform more significant modifications (e.g., slimmer grip radius) if time and context allow.

#### 3.7.6 Remote Fitting Success

- When the shooter is not present, mastery shows when:  
  - A gun built to supplied measurements fits well “out of the case.”  
  - Only minor adjustments are needed locally.  
- Fitter anticipates realistic variation and prepares the gun with **adjustability and guidance** for any future tweaks.

#### 3.7.7 The “Part of Me” Test

- Ultimate sign of success: the shooter mounts the gun, shoots, and says some version of  
  **“It feels like a part of me.”**  
- At that point, the fitter has aligned decades of craft and factory work with the individual shooter’s body and style.

---

## 4. Edge Cases, Exceptions, and Caveats

### 4.1 Unrealistic Expectations

- Some shooters may ask for outcomes beyond what fit can provide (e.g., “zero recoil,” dramatic weight changes on a finished gun).  
- Fitter must communicate **realistic limits** while offering the best possible improvements within physics and practical constraints.

### 4.2 Extreme Anatomical or Preference Requirements

- Very unusual dimensions (e.g., extreme cast, exceptionally short/long LOP) may exceed safe bending or adjustment ranges.  
- In such cases, major alterations (e.g., drastically different stock design) might be required, which are not always feasible at final-fitting stage.

### 4.3 Major Changes Discovered Late

- Significant fit problems identified at this stage (e.g., hopelessly wrong base measurements) may necessitate more serious work such as:  
  - A new stock.  
  - Substantial barrel or rib adjustments.  
- Such situations are rare but must be handled honestly and with a clear plan.

### 4.4 Break-In Period for Shooter

- Even with excellent fitting, shooters may need a **few hundred targets** to fully adapt.  
- Fitter may deliberately avoid micro‑tuning based on first impressions and instead schedule follow‑up adjustments after the shooter has gained experience.

### 4.5 Local Gunsmith Collaboration for Remote Clients

- For remote buyers, final tweaks may be done by a trusted local gunsmith using the factory’s measurement records and guidance.  
- Fitter anticipates this and ensures adjustments and hardware (e.g., adjustable comb) are straightforward to understand and modify.
