## 1. High-Level Overview

This document describes the **Patterning & Performance Testing station** in the Perazzi factory.

At this station, the **fully assembled shotgun** is test-fired with **live ammunition** to verify:

- **Point of impact (POI)** and barrel **regulation** (how the two barrels’ POIs relate).
- **Pattern distribution and density** for each barrel vs. its choke designation.
- **Live-fire behavior** of mechanical systems already checked in dry tests:
  - Ejectors/extractors.
  - Trigger reset and second-shot function (especially inertia triggers).
  - Overall recoil feel and functioning under real conditions.

This station provides the final **performance proof** that the gun:

- Shoots where it is supposed to shoot (for the intended discipline and customer specification).
- Produces patterns that match choke expectations.
- Behaves mechanically under recoil as expected.

The output is a **test‑fired, performance-verified shotgun**, often with pattern data that can be shared with the customer or used for final fitting.

## 2. Key Concepts & Glossary

### 2.1 Roles and Station

- **Patterning & Performance Testing Station (canonical)**  
  - Synonyms: *Patterning Range*, *Test-Fire Range*, *Performance Test Station*.  
  - Definition: Station where completed guns are fired at pattern plates or paper targets to verify POI, regulation, and pattern quality, and to confirm functioning under live fire.

- **Pattern Tester / Performance Tester (canonical)**  
  - Synonyms: *Test-Fire Gunsmith*, *Patterning Specialist*, *Range Technician*.  
  - Definition: Craftsperson responsible for setting up tests, firing the gun, interpreting results, and deciding whether the gun passes or requires adjustment.

### 2.2 Pattern & POI Concepts

- **Point of Impact (POI)**  
  - The center of the shot pattern relative to the **point of aim** at a given distance.

- **Regulation (for Over/Under)**  
  - Relationship of POI between the two barrels:  
    - For most clay guns, both barrels are regulated to essentially the **same POI**.  
    - For specialized use (e.g., trap), bottom barrel might be set slightly higher per customer specification.

- **Pattern Percentage**  
  - Approximate percentage of pellets within a defined circle (e.g., **30" circle at 40 yards**).  
  - Example: a “Full” choke might give ~70% of pellets in that circle; a more open choke might give ~55%.

- **Pattern Evenness / Uniformity**  
  - How evenly pellets are spread within the pattern circle; absence of large “holes” (voids).

- **POI Ratios (e.g., 60/40)**  
  - Describes how much of the pattern is above vs. below the point of aim at test distance.  
  - Example: **60/40 high** for trap means ~60% of the pellets above and 40% below the aiming point.

### 2.3 Test Environment & Distance Concepts

- **Pattern Distance**  
  - Typical distances used:  
    - **35–40 meters** for full pattern evaluation.  
    - Sometimes shorter distances (e.g., 15–20 m) for more precise POI/regulation checks.

- **Pattern Plate vs Paper**  
  - **Pattern Plate**: steel plate coated with whitewash/paint; pellet strike leaves visible marks.  
  - **Pattern Paper**: large paper sheets (e.g., ~1 m²) used to capture patterns for detailed analysis or customer presentation.

- **Indoor Patterning Board**  
  - Long dark room with a **moving steel plate** that can be set at different ranges; allows controlled, all-weather testing.

- **Outdoor Range (Test Range Behind the Factory)**  
  - Used for longer range or final tests, including gunsmith evaluation with live fire.

### 2.4 Chokes & Loads

- **Choke Designation**  
  - Examples: Full, Improved Modified, Modified, etc.  
  - Expected to correlate with pattern density at test distance:
    - Tight chokes → tighter, denser patterns.
    - More open chokes → wider, less dense patterns.

- **Test Ammunition**  
  - Typically **standard target loads**, often matching common usage (e.g., #8 shot for clays).  
  - May vary if customer requests test with specific ammunition.

- **Load Influence**  
  - While POI is mostly driven by gun geometry, different loads can influence:
    - Pattern density and uniformity.
    - Slight changes in recoil behavior that can affect felt performance.

### 2.5 Mechanical Behavior Under Live Fire

- **Ejector/Extractor Function**  
  - Ejectors must throw fired hulls clear; unfired shells should extract without ejection.  
  - Live fire confirms behavior under realistic pressure and vibration.

- **Trigger Reset & Doubling**  
  - Inertia triggers must reset reliably under actual recoil.  
  - Any **doubling** (both barrels firing on one pull) under live fire is unacceptable and triggers rework.

- **Recoil Feel**  
  - Overall recoil “sharpness” and balance under typical shooting conditions.  
  - Not a pass/fail metric alone, but one of the cues used in evaluating the gun.

## 3. Main Content

### 3.1 Station Purpose & Success Criteria

#### 3.1.1 Purpose

The **Patterning & Performance Testing station**:

- Verifies that **both barrels hit where they should** at typical pattern distances.  
- Confirms that **pattern density and evenness** align with choke designations and intended use.  
- Tests the **functional reliability** of ejectors, triggers, and other systems under **live-fire recoil**.  
- Provides data to support **final fitting and adjustments** (e.g., comb height, adjustable rib position) when the customer or fitter is involved.

It is the final **ballistic and functional validation** of the shotgun.

#### 3.1.2 Success Criteria

Success is achieved when:

- **POI & Regulation**  
  - At standard pattern distance (often **35–40 m**), both barrels’ patterns are correctly centered (or at the requested offset) relative to the aiming point.  
  - For competition O/U guns, barrels typically print **to the same POI**, with small, acceptable variations.  
  - If a POI ratio (e.g., **60/40 high** for trap) is specified, patterns match that ratio within reasonable tolerance.

- **Pattern Quality**  
  - Patterns show appropriate **density** for the choke designation:
    - Example: a tighter choke might show ~70% of pellets in a 30" circle at 40 yards; a more open choke ~55% (numbers approximate, used as sanity checks).  
  - Patterns are **even**, with no large voids or obvious “donut” effects.

- **Mechanical Reliability Under Live Fire**  
  - Ejectors function correctly with fired hulls and behave as extractors for unfired shells.  
  - Triggers reset consistently; second shot works under recoil; **no doubling** occurs.  
  - No new mechanical anomalies appear (e.g., no sticking, binding, or inconsistent behavior under recoil).

- **Practical Tolerances**  
  - Small deviations (e.g., a few centimeters off at 35 m) are acceptable, as patterns are broad and shooters can adapt.  
  - Significant, consistent offsets (e.g., patterns a foot high or obviously left/right) are not acceptable and require correction.

- **Customer-Specific Goals (When Present)**  
  - If a custom POI or pattern requirement was specified, testing confirms that the gun meets those parameters or is adjusted to do so.

### 3.3 Core Knowledge & Skills

#### 3.3.1 Marksmanship & Setup

- Ability to **aim and fire consistently** at the aiming mark, minimizing human error:  
  - Use of bench rests or supports to stabilize the gun.  
  - Understanding that pattern spread tolerates some aiming variation, but POI evaluation still requires care.

- Selecting appropriate **distances** and setups for:
  - POI and regulation checks (often 15–20 m or 35–40 m depending on desired insight).  
  - Full pattern spread analysis (typically at 35–40 m).

#### 3.3.2 Pattern Analysis

- Interpreting pattern boards or papers to determine:

  - **Pattern center**:  
    - Locating densest area or using simple techniques (visual estimation; folding paper, etc.).

  - **Offset from aiming point**:  
    - Measuring horizontal and vertical distances from aim to pattern center.

  - **Pattern density & distribution**:  
    - Judging whether the pattern is appropriate for the choke designation (tight vs open).  
    - Spotting large voids or unusual shapes (e.g., “donut” patterns).

- Distinguishing between **ammo-related anomalies** and **barrel-related issues** by:
  - Re-shooting with the same load.  
  - Testing another brand or load if needed.

#### 3.3.3 Adjustment Methods & POI Tuning

- Knowing how to correct POI issues:

  - **Barrel Bending (Small Corrections)**  
    - Using a bending vise to make small horizontal or vertical POI corrections.  
    - Reserved for minor adjustments; more substantial misalignment may require re-regulation.

  - **Adjustable Rib Use (Where Present)**  
    - Adjusting rib height at muzzle or other points to move POI up or down.  
    - Setting factory “baseline” positions for standard POI ratios (e.g., 60/40 for certain trap models).

  - **Stock & Comb Adjustments**  
    - Using adjustable combs to raise or lower POI, or alter lateral POI via cast.  
    - Understanding approximate relationships: e.g., small comb changes (on the order of fractions of an inch) correspond to several inches of POI shift at 35–40 m.

- Using **iterative testing**:
  - Adjust, re-test, confirm.  
  - Keeping track of changes to avoid overshooting target POI.

#### 3.3.4 Ammunition Knowledge

- Understanding how different loads influence:

  - **Pattern density and character** (e.g., hard vs soft shot, wad design).  
  - **Recoil behavior**, which can slightly influence how the gun moves and feels in the shooter’s hands.

- Selecting a **representative test load**:
  - Typical target loads for clays guns.  
  - Specific customer loads for bespoke testing if requested.

#### 3.3.5 Safety & Range Procedure

- Maintaining **safe gun handling** and range discipline while:

  - Test-firing many guns per day.  
  - Switching loads and guns frequently.

- Using ear and eye protection consistently.

#### 3.3.6 Customer Interaction & Communication (When Present)

- Explaining pattern results in **clear, practical terms**:

  - Showing how patterns relate to real targets (e.g., rising trap birds vs crossers).  
  - Explaining what “60/40 high” or “dead-on 50/50” means in practice.

- Differentiating **gun vs shooter** factors:

  - If a benched gun prints dead-on but the shooter’s patterns are off, recognizing that stock fit (cast, drop) or mount may be the issue.  
  - Suggesting comb or cast adjustments rather than barrel work when the problem is shooter-specific.

#### 3.3.7 Iterative Final Fitting Support

- Working with fitters and shooters to:

  - Fine-tune adjustable combs and ribs.  
  - Perform multiple pattern tests as necessary to reach the shooter’s preferred POI.

- Remembering approximate rules of thumb for how much adjustment is needed to move POI by a given amount at distance.

#### 3.3.8 Quality & Feedback Mindset

- Recognizing that pattern testing is:

  - A **proof of craftsmanship** (barrel regulation, stock fit, choke work).  
  - A **feedback loop** to earlier stations when rare but important deviations appear.

---

### 3.4 Decisions & Trade-Offs

#### 3.4.1 Test Distance Choices

- **Shorter Distance (e.g., 15–20 m)**  
  - Pros: easier to see precise POI and differences between barrels (smaller pattern; center easier to locate).  
  - Cons: less information about full pattern spread and choke behavior.

- **Standard Pattern Distance (e.g., 35–40 m)**  
  - Pros: standard reference for pattern density and spread; aligns with conventional pattern metrics.  
  - Cons: patterns are broader; small POI differences are a bit harder to assess visually.

**Practical approach:**  
- Some testers may use **both**: shorter range for fine POI/regulation checks and standard distance for full pattern analysis.  
- Others may rely mainly on the standard distance, trusting upstream barrel regulation and focusing on confirmation.

#### 3.4.2 Number of Shots per Barrel

- **Fewer Shots (1–2 per barrel)**  
  - Pros: faster throughput; sufficient when upstream quality and regulation are reliable.  
  - Cons: patterning has inherent shot-to-shot variability; fewer samples mean less statistical certainty.

- **More Shots**  
  - Pros: higher confidence in pattern consistency and POI.  
  - Cons: more ammo and time; usually unnecessary if no anomalies are seen.

**Practical approach:**  
- Fire **at least one** well-aimed shot per barrel; shoot follow-up patterns if results are questionable.  
- Use experience to determine when a second or third pattern is needed for confirmation.

#### 3.4.3 Rest vs Shoulder Aiming

- **Bench/Rest Aiming**  
  - Pros: minimizes human error; best for objective POI/regulation evaluation.  
  - Cons: may not perfectly replicate how some shooters view the rib when shouldering.

- **Shouldered Aiming (with Experienced Tester or Shooter)**  
  - Pros: more representative of real-world use; helpful when shooter is present for fitting.  
  - Cons: introduces human variability; less objective than bench tests.

**Practical approach:**  
- Use **bench or rest** for factory POI/regulation checks.  
- When customer is present, also have them shoot patterns from the shoulder to evaluate fit and mount.

#### 3.4.4 Ammunition Selection

- **Standard Factory Load**  
  - Pros: consistent reference; easy to compare performance across guns.  
  - Cons: may not reflect specific customer ammunition choices.

- **Customer-Specified Load**  
  - Pros: reveals how the gun behaves with the shooter’s real-world ammo.  
  - Cons: more variables; results specific to that load.

**Practical approach:**  
- Use a **trusted, consistent target load** for QC.  
- Add customer-specific ammo tests if required, recording any notable differences.

#### 3.4.5 Acceptable POI Tolerance

- Deciding what counts as “close enough”:

  - POI deviations of a **few centimeters at 35 m** are generally acceptable given pattern size.  
  - Larger, consistent deviations (e.g., **~10 cm or more**) may be considered out-of-spec and trigger corrective action.

- Recognizing that **practical shooting** allows some tolerance, but premium guns aim for **very tight regulation**.

#### 3.4.6 Choke Evaluation

- Interpreting patterns vs choke expectations:

  - If patterns look too open or too tight relative to the stamped choke, check:
    - Choke constriction measurements.  
    - Ammunition type.

- Deciding whether to:

  - Accept minor pattern differences as normal ammo variation.  
  - Re‑check choke dimensions.  
  - In rare cases, adjust choke cutting.

#### 3.4.7 Documentation & Customer Artifacts

- Whether to:

  - Provide a **physical test target** to the customer.  
  - Record pattern data internally only.  
  - Use pattern photographs or brief written notes as proof of testing.

---

### 3.5 Tools & Measurements (Conceptual Level)

#### 3.5.1 Patterning Targets & Marking

- **Pattern Plate**  
  - Steel plate, recoated between shots with:
    - Whitewash.  
    - Paint (e.g., roller-applied).  
  - Shot impacts leave visible marks for quick assessment.

- **Pattern Paper**  
  - Large sheets with central aiming mark.  
  - After shooting:
    - Identify densest area and draw **30" circle** around it to judge coverage.  
    - Optionally divide into quadrants for more detailed uniformity checks.

- **Marking Tools**  
  - Pens, chalk, and markers to:
    - Indicate barrel used, distance, load, date.  
    - Draw circles and record measurements.

#### 3.5.2 Support & Measurement Tools

- **Bench Rest / Sandbags / Test Rig**  
  - Stabilizes the gun for precise POI evaluation.

- **Tape Measure / Ruler**  
  - Measures:
    - Offset of pattern center from aiming point (vertical and horizontal).  
    - Pattern diameter or radius.

- **Choke Gauges & Bore Meters**  
  - Used to verify choke constriction if patterns suggest anomalies.

#### 3.5.3 Counting & Estimation Tools

- **Pellet Count Reference**  
  - Knowledge of approximate pellet counts per load (e.g., 1 oz #7.5 ≈ known pellet count range) to relate pellet hits to pattern percentages.

- **Visual Estimation**  
  - Experienced testers often rely on **visual assessment** rather than exhaustive pellet counting for routine QC.

#### 3.5.4 Safety & Record-Keeping

- **Safety Gear**  
  - Ear protection.  
  - Eye protection.

- **Logs / QC Forms**  
  - Notebook or forms documenting:
    - Date, serial number, barrels tested, distance, ammo, and summary result.  
  - Modern workflows may also involve digital records or photos of key patterns.

---

### 3.6 Failure Modes & Diagnosis

#### 3.6.1 Mis-Regulation (Barrels Not Shooting Together)

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Barrel patterns consistently separated in POI (e.g., one high, one low, or one left/right of the other) beyond acceptable tolerance.

- **Diagnosis:**  
  - Multiple patterns per barrel to confirm consistent offset.  
  - Testing at shorter and standard distances to see how separation scales.

- **Potential Causes:**  
  - Barrel regulation error not fully corrected earlier.  
  - Slight misalignment introduced during later work.

- **Remedies:**  
  - **Minor offsets**: barrel bending to bring POIs together.  
  - **Significant mis-regulation**: may require barrel disassembly/re‑regulation (major rework, avoided unless necessary).

#### 3.6.2 Barrels Crossing

- **Symptoms:**  
  - At a given distance, one barrel’s POI crosses over the other’s (e.g., left barrel hitting right of right barrel’s POI).  

- **Diagnosis:**  
  - Multiple patterns confirming consistent crossover behavior.  

- **Remedies:**  
  - Generally indicative of a more serious regulation error; likely requires re‑regulation and re‑soldering.

#### 3.6.3 POI Mismatch vs Intended Use

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Gun patterns at 50/50 when built for 70/30 high (or vice versa).  

- **Diagnosis:**  
  - Compare patterns and ratios (above/below aim point) to customer spec.

- **Remedies:**  
  - Adjust **comb height** or **adjustable rib** to raise/lower POI.  
  - For fixed configurations, consider stock bending or modifying comb height.

#### 3.6.4 Irregular or Poor Patterns

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Patchy patterns with large holes; odd shapes (e.g., “donut” where center is thin and outer ring dense).

- **Potential Causes:**  
  - Barrel or choke issues (e.g., slight internal defect, burrs).  
  - Load-specific anomalies (wad behavior, shot quality).

- **Diagnosis & Remedies:**  
  - Re-test with the same load and a different load to distinguish ammo vs barrel issues.  
  - Inspect choke and bore; polish or correct any visible burrs.  
  - In rare cases, re-cut choke or replace barrel if patterns remain consistently poor.

#### 3.6.5 Ejection or Trigger Issues Under Recoil

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Ejectors fail to throw shells clear or behave inconsistently under live fire.  
  - Trigger issues such as:
    - Failure to reset second shot.  
    - Doubling that did not appear in dry tests.

- **Diagnosis & Remedies:**  
  - Inspect and adjust ejector springs, channels, and trip mechanisms; polish where necessary.  
  - Adjust inertia block or sear engagement; increase safety margins to prevent doubling.  
  - Confirm fixes with further live-fire tests.

#### 3.6.6 Excessive Recoil or Poor Balance (Subjective)

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Test shooter perceives recoil as unusually sharp; gun feels unbalanced compared to expectation.

- **Diagnosis:**  
  - Compare with similar models; consider overall weight and balance.  
  - Evaluate whether this is a design/weight choice or an anomaly.

- **Remedies:**  
  - Small adjustments such as adding weight to stock (e.g., through stock bolt channel) may soften recoil feel.  
  - May suggest changes in recoil pad or shooter setup rather than structural gun changes.

#### 3.6.7 Sight & Bead Alignment Issues

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Test shooter notices misalignment of front bead or mid-bead with rib line.  

- **Diagnosis:**  
  - Visual inspection of beads and rib: off-center beads, canted threads.

- **Remedies:**  
  - Re-align or replace beads; ensure proper centering and orientation.

---

### 3.7 What Mastery Looks Like

Mastery at this station lies in **rapid, accurate interpretation** of patterns, efficient corrections, and collaboration with fitters and customers.

#### 3.7.1 Fast, Accurate Reading of Patterns

- A master pattern tester can glance at a pattern and quickly see:

  - POI offset in inches/centimeters at distance.  
  - Whether pattern density matches choke expectations.  
  - Whether any irregularity is likely due to the gun or the ammunition.

- They often **do not need to count pellets**; experience lets them evaluate patterns qualitatively but accurately.

#### 3.7.2 Clear Differentiation of Gun vs Shooter Effects

- When the shooter is present:

  - They can tell whether an off-center pattern is due to the **gun** or the shooter’s **mount and fit**.  
  - If a benched gun is correct but shoulder-fired patterns are off, they look to **comb height, cast, and fit** rather than barrel tweaking.

#### 3.7.3 Efficient, Structured Workflow

- Masters may pattern **many guns daily**, yet maintain:

  - Routine test distances and targets.  
  - Simple but effective notes or logs.  
  - A repeatable sequence: bottom barrel → top barrel, etc.

- They rely on upstream quality and are vigilant for anomalies rather than over‑testing every gun unnecessarily.

#### 3.7.4 Integrating Technical Results with Fitting

- They work closely with fitters and customers to fine-tune:

  - Adjustable comb height and cast.  
  - Adjustable ribs and other tunable features.

> **Example vignette (composite, illustrative):**  
> At the pattern range, Mario fires the bottom barrel at 35 meters. The pattern is centered but a bit low. The top barrel’s pattern on a fresh sheet lands almost at the same point, maybe a couple of centimeters lower. The gun is for a trap shooter who requested a 60/40 high pattern, but this is closer to 50/50.  
> Mario adjusts the comb up by a small, known amount and has the shooter fire next from the bench. The pattern center rises and now sits in the 60/40 zone. Mario nods, locks the comb hardware, and notes the final setting. The shooter later comments that the gun seems to “break targets just by looking at them,” unaware of the precise iterative work that dialed in that feel.

#### 3.7.5 Care After Testing & Feedback to Factory

- Masters clean the gun after patterning:

  - Remove powder residue from bores and action.  
  - Lightly re‑oil and wipe external surfaces.

- They also:

  - Note recurring patterns in QC (e.g., if a model is consistently a little high or left).  
  - Communicate these trends back to barrel regulators, fitters, or engineering for possible process adjustments.

## 4. Edge Cases, Exceptions, and Caveats

### 4.1 Extreme POI Requests

- Some shooters request **very high or unusual POIs**.  
- Not all extremes are structurally or practically achievable with fixed barrel geometry; adjustable combs and ribs have limits.

**Caveat:**  
The tester and fitter may need to discuss realistic POI ranges with the customer.

### 4.2 Significant Mis-Regulation Discovered Late

- Rarely, a gun reaches this stage with significant regulation errors.  
- Correcting such issues often requires **major rework** (re‑regulation, re‑soldering barrels), which is costly but necessary to uphold quality standards.

### 4.3 Ammo-Specific Performance

- Some combinations of barrel and load may show unusual but repeatable behavior (e.g., certain wad/shot types).  
- Where anomalies seem load-specific, the gun may still be within spec if it performs normally with standard loads.

**Caveat:**  
If a customer intends to use such loads, testers may recommend alternative ammunition or caution about that specific combination.

### 4.4 Customer Perception vs Objective Results

- Customers may be sensitive to small perceived POI offsets or pattern nuances.  
- Testers must balance technical confidence in results with clear explanation and, when needed, **small adjustments** that align gun behavior with customer comfort.

## 5. References & Cross-Links

- **Upstream Stations:**  
  - **Barrel Fabrication & Regulation (Part II.C)** – provides regulated barrel sets; pattern testing confirms their performance in the assembled gun.  
  - **Assembly & Mechanical QC (Part II.J)** – ensures mechanical reliability under dry tests; patterning verifies live-fire behavior.  
  - **Stock Inletting, Checkering, and Wood Finishing (Parts II.F–II.I)** – determine fit and feel; pattern testing helps finalize POI relative to the shooter.

- **Downstream / Related:**  
  - **Final Fitting & Customer-Specific Adjustments (Part III – Final Fit & Handover, conceptual)** – uses patterning results to fine-tune fit in the shooter’s hands.  
  - **Final Proof & Sign-Off** – after patterning and adjustments, the gun is ready for final administrative checks and delivery.

- **Narrative Transition:**  
  - With patterning and performance testing complete—and any final POI adjustments made—the gun has proven itself both mechanically and ballistically. The next stages focus on **final fitting, customer handover, and long-term ownership considerations**, completing the journey from raw materials to a finished Perazzi shotgun.
