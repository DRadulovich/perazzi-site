## 1. High-Level Overview

Perazzi’s audience can be understood through a set of **five motivational archetypes**. These are not boxes or rigid labels; they are patterns in what people value, what they are seeking, and how they relate to a gun that is more than equipment.

The archetypes described here are:

- **Loyalist**  
- **Prestige**  
- **Analyst**  
- **Achiever**  
- **Legacy**

Each archetype represents:

- A **core drive** (What do they want from their gun and brand?).  
- A **relationship posture** (How do they show up toward Perazzi?).  
- A set of **resonant messages** (What language, stories, and emphasis feel natural to them?).

Most real people are a **blend** of these archetypes. The goal is not to label individuals, but to recognize patterns so that:

- Brand communication feels like it “gets” them.  
- Guidance from Perazzi (human or digital) can meet them where they are, while still pulling them toward the deeper ethos of the brand.

## 4. Blends and Overlaps

Most real users will not fit a single archetype cleanly. Common blends include:

- **Loyalist–Achiever**  
  - Has already committed to Perazzi and cares deeply about performance.  
  - Responds to both continuity and serious training language.

- **Prestige–Legacy**  
  - Cares about visual distinction now and heirloom value later.  
  - Responds to stories about craft and future significance.

- **Analyst–Achiever**  
  - Wants to understand the mechanics behind performance.  
  - Responds well to detailed explanations that connect setup to results.

- **Loyalist–Legacy**  
  - Often tied to family or mentor history with Perazzi.  
  - Sees the gun as part of a multi-generation story.

PerazziGPT should treat these archetypes as **motivational lenses**, not labels. They are helpful for choosing emphasis and examples, not for deciding what is true or what the user “is.”

## 5. Guidance for PerazziGPT (AI Use Only)

> This section is for AI behavior and retrieval purposes. It is safe to keep in the corpus but should not be recited verbatim.

- Use these archetypes **implicitly** to:
  - Choose which **aspects of Perazzi** to highlight (heritage, artistry, specifications, performance, legacy).
  - Choose what kind of **examples and stories** to offer (champions, factory, multi-generational ownership, event experiences).

- Do **not**:
  - Tell a user “You are a [Archetype].”
  - Insist that a user “fits” one of these categories.
  - Change the **facts** of an answer based on archetype—only the framing and emphasis.

- When users ask questions like:
  - “Why would someone choose Perazzi early in their career?”
  - “What type of shooter tends to gravitate toward Perazzi?”
  
  You may draw on this document to explain that:
  - People who choose Perazzi often care about:
    - Long-term relationship with their gun (Loyalist, Legacy).
    - Distinction and craft (Prestige).
    - Clear logic and serious competition (Analyst, Achiever).
  - Different aspects of the brand speak more strongly to different motivations, but all are anchored in:
    - Craftsmanship,
    - Serious competition use,
    - The idea of a gun as a long-term partner.

- Always keep the explanation focused on **Perazzi and the shooter**, not on internal AI mechanics or scoring systems.
